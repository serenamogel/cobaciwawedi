Everything Sanji did in Whole Cake Island was to protect his friends. Luffy already knew that he would never willingly leave his pirate crew.</span></span><h2>Who is the traitor in One Piece?</h2>Kanjuro stayed behind on the coast in secret, sending a drawing clone onto the boat with the other retainers. As Kin'emon wondered about the possibility of a traitor among them, Kanjuro's clone then revealed that he was the traitor.<h2>Does Sanji betray Luffy?</h2>Sanji will instead betray the Straw Hat Pirates and attack Luffy, with Luffy finding it difficult to fight his friend for real. Both men are already beaten and bruised after their recent fights, with neither of them wanting to give up on their ambitions.<h2>Did Nami betray Luffy?</h2>At first, Nami was excited to join the crew but grew more reluctant once she learned that Luffy is a pirate because of her disgust of pirates. She betrayed Luffy and even wished him dead before he formed a crew.<h2>What episode does Luffy betray?</h2>The Luffy-Law Pirate Alliance!" is the 594th episode of the One Piece anime.<h2>Nami Betrays Luffy Again Episode 1008</h2><p></p><h2>Who wins Luffy or Law?</h2>1) Monkey D.<p>While Luffy does seem to lack an Awakening (which Law already has for his own Devil Fruit), the Straw Hat Captain is undoubtedly stronger.</p><h2>Is Law a traitor One Piece?</h2>Law is the traitor! He did turn on the Straw Hats! Well, maybe not really, but he told them to go to Zo. But then why did he say that he was in an alliance with them, losing his Shichibukai status just to by time?<h2>Who will be traitor in straw hat?</h2>9 Heartbreaking: Pudding Betrays The Straw Hats<p>Immediately after her debut, Pudding not only won the trust of the Straw Hats but she also won the hearts of the fans.</p><h2>Who is the most loyal straw hat?</h2>Of all the Straw Hats, Zoro is by far the most loyal, and he has strong leadership and reasoning skills.<h2>Why did Zoro betray Luffy?</h2>Zoro will never betray Luffy even if it means death. Zoro is Luffy's first crewmate and he's very loyal towards him. He saved Luffy from Bartholomew Kuma by taking all the pain Luffy took in his battle against Gecko Moria. If Zoro ever betray Luffy, Luffy might put on a rampage.<h2>Who dies in One Piece crew?</h2><p>Luffy with the lofty goals of finding pirates' greatest treasure, the One Piece and becoming the esteemed Pirate King.<br>...<br>One Piece: 10 Deaths That Rocked The Anime's Foundation, Ranked</p><ul><li>10 Queen Otohime. ...</li><li>9 Shimotsuki Yasuie. ...</li><li>8 Bell-mère. ...</li><li>7 Pedro. ...</li><li>6 Donquioxte Rosinante. ...</li><li>5 Kozuki Oden. ...</li><li>4 Whitebeard. ...</li><li>3 Merry.</li></ul><h2>Did Zoro leave the crew?</h2>Zoro then goes on to say that he cannot trust a guy that decides to quit the crew then just come back. He adds that if the first thing he hears from Usopp is an outright apology, then he will let him rejoin but will leave if he makes an excuse. Sanji actually agrees with Zoro and Luffy accepts that he is right.<h2>Is Luffy the joy boy?</h2>Noting that he feels like fate is at work, he's now putting his full trust in Luffy. So it's not that Luffy has become Joy Boy, and necessarily gained a title, but he's become like that figure.<h2>Who killed Kanjuro?</h2>With Kinemon stepping up to the plate, wearing his anger on his sleeve, Oden's right-hand man is able to deliver a killing blow to Kanjuro, who is able to deliver some final words that sting the Vassal even more: "That's it.<h2>Who is Wano traitor?</h2>It's here that the Akazaya Nine starts to face the truth that one of them is actually a traitor, and soon Kanjuro reveals that he has been the betrayer all along. Confirming what Orochi said in the previous episode, Kanjuro revealed that his real name is Kanjuro Kurozumi.<h2>Who is Luffy's strongest crewmate?</h2>2 Roronoa Zoro, The Swordsman<p>He also has Conqueror's Haki; however, the power lays dormant within him. Currently Zoro is fighting King the Wildfire on Onigashima, showing that he's truly Luffy's strongest crewman at the moment.</p><h2>Who gave Luffy a scar?</h2>Jinbe was carrying luffy after he lost conscience after ace died and Akainu attacked Jinbe. He pierced right through Jinbe's chest and hit luffy. When they show luffy again he as the X shaped scar on his chest.<h2>Who is the 11th Straw Hat?</h2>They were speculations that the next crew member might be carrot, who has been traveling alongside Mugiwara since the Whole Cake Island ark, but these spoilers have confirmed that Yamato is the 11th member that will join Luffy in his next adventures.<h2>Does Nico Robin betray Luffy?</h2>Robin: after what Luffy did for her at Enies Lobby, she'll be with him till the end. Sanji: with everything that's gone on in the Whole Cake Island arc, he'll remain faithful to Luffy. There's the issue of the fight they had, but he did it because he cared about the crew.<h2>Why did usopp betray Luffy?</h2>All this was fuelled by his insecurity about not being powerful or useful enough to the crew and feeling inferior in terms of strength. Usopp fought Luffy, lost, and left the crew. After the events of Enies Lobby wrapped up, he apologized to Luffy and was invited back on the team once more.<h2>Is Nico Robin loyal to Luffy?</h2>Robin feeds Luffy some of her food whilst riding through Punk Hazard. Robin also seems to be very devoted to Luffy, as he is the only person whom she wants to get stronger for. This shows how great her dedication to her captain has become after the Enies Lobby Arc.<h2>Does Law join Luffys crew?</h2>No one would be surprised if, after the events of Wano, Law decides to keep his relationship with the crew going and formally joins the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, possibly as its 2nd Division commander.<h2>Does Law see Luffy as a friend?</h2>Luffy agreed, making their crews allies in a relationship (which Luffy perceives to be as practically a friendship, but Law sees as more of a professional agreement). Luffy often treats him very casually, like a good friend, something which Law usually frowns upon.<h2>Who betrayed Oden?</h2>Kanjuro, one of the nine red scabbards, is one who betrayed Oden, his vassals, and the entirety of Wano. He did this because he is actually of the Kurozumi clan.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaalam%2FosXSZqOunpau</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tamara-craig-thomas-biography-heritage-age-weight-height-relationships.html><span>←</span><span>Tamara Craig Thomas Biography, History, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships</span></a>
