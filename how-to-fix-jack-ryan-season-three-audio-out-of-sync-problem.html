A character on the screen will speak, and then a few seconds later the audio will actually come through.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Needless to say, this is a pretty suboptimal way of viewing the latest season of the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which we thought was pretty good, if not more of the same</a>. Amazon has reportedly fixed the problem, but some people are still experiencing the issue – so we’ve compiled all of the troubleshooting steps you need to know if you’re trying to troubleshoot this irksome bug.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Change your audio output</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jack Ryan Season 3 is out. However Amazon Prime hasn't fixed the audio sync. Pretty bad when you have to change the ouput to fix the issue yourself. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KzUGT0NBwF</a></p>— Brady Johnson (@eagle12510) <a href=#>December 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>This Twitter user appeared to be able to resolve the audio problem by changing the audio output on their TV from Dolby Atmos to Dolby Digital Plus, showcasing that the show’s audio was out of sync while using Atmos, then completely fine after switching to Digital Plus. If this is an option that is available on your device, give it a go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Switch to descriptive audio</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@PrimeVideo</a> I’m trying to watch Jack Ryan S3. E1 played fine. 2 & 3 the audio lag is bad. Words are heard well after the character is finished speaking.

If you don’t mind using this audio option while Amazon resolves outlying cases of the audio problem, it is available.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-contact-prime-video-support data-injectable=false><strong>Contact Prime Video support</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hello.

You can tweet at the official Amazon Help account, but they are likely to direct you to the contact link in the above tweet. If the issue continues to persist for you and neither of the above solutions has been of help, this looks like your best bet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9Zmq6hllp7FbrbAnKJmqqmWu26%2FxJqqqKZdqbWzscRmmK6cmaR6sMHTZqafZaOuu6R5z6umm6SVonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./don-omar.html><span>←</span><span>Don Omar Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
