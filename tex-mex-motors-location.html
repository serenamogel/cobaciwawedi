It’s a fairly conventional makeover <a href=#><strong>reality program</strong></a>.</p><p>On the other hand, the location of the series also serves as an attraction for the viewers. As a result, many people have been wanting to know where it was filmed.

Well, now let’s discuss the filming location in detail.</p><h3>El Paso, Texas</h3><p>The experts transport the gathered vintage cars to Texas, primarily to El Paso. It also goes by the name Sun City, and it’s where several crucial scenes from Tex Mex Motors were filmed. It is a borderline between the United States and Mexico.</p><p>The twenty-second-largest city in the US, El Paso, is <a href=# rel=noopener>located</a> on the Rio Grande, on the other side of the border from Ciudad Juarez. It has a history of hosting filming locations, and you may undoubtedly be well aware that The Bridge and the second season of Breaking Bad were both filmed there.</p><h3>Celeste, Texas</h3><p>The video crew also establishes a base of operations at Zachary Customs, located at 8221 Co Road 1084 in Celeste, as the experts transform the cars in the auto restoration service facility with meticulous attention to detail. According to reports, they were also seen filming a couple more episodes of the show in various areas of the West Texas region.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/06/celeste-texas.jpg alt="Few scenes are filmed in Celeste, Texas as well. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Few scenes are filmed in Celeste, Texas as well.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Texas Escapes</strong></p><h3>Mexico</h3><p>In order to find abandoned automobiles that they can magically fix, the team of experts first travels all the way to Mexico. The distinctive Mexican landscape can be seen in the background, which gives the visuals for Tex Mex Motors additional depth. Mexico, sometimes known as the United Mexican States, is recognized for having a huge network of roads, as evidenced by the numerous multi-lane expressways that can be seen in various sequences of the Netflix series.</p><p>Furthermore, because there are numerous out shots of Mexico throughout the show, it is very probable that you will notice some popular monuments in the background, such as the Plaza de la Constitución, the Chapultepec Castle, the National Museum of Anthropology, and the Plaza de las Tres Culturas.</p><h3>Juarez, Mexico</h3><p>Additionally, Tex Mex Motors makes numerous pit stops in Juarez. The most populous city in the Mexican State of Chihuahua is Juarez, which was formerly known as El Paso del Norte until 1888. Given its dense population, it makes likely that the crew would have a higher likelihood of discovering abandoned cars there.</p><p>Tex Mex Motors is now&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>streaming</a>&nbsp;on Netflix.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2024/03/bikram-karki.jpeg width=100 height=100 alt="Bikram Karki" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a href=# class="vcard author" rel=author><span class=fn>Bikram Karki</span></a><p>Bikram Karki, a visionary entrepreneur hailing from Kathmandu, Nepal, is the driving force behind Blurred Reality and its parent company, Selectiveyes Group Pvt.
