For one, the U.S. Board of Treasury claimed Hopkinson wasn’t the flag’s sole designer, meaning he shouldn’t receive all the credit. Additionally, the board felt the affluent Hopkinson owed a service to the public, and members considered the flag his contribution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Plus, the young government didn’t exactly have a lot of money to throw around. “It was 1780, and the country was broke from fighting the war.
