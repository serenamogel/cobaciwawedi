Discovered in an amateur contest, she went on to become the top female jazz singer for decades. In 1958, Fitzgerald made history as the first African American woman to win a Grammy Award. Due in no small part to her vocal quality, with lucid intonation and a broad range, the singer would go on to win 13 Grammys in total and sell more than 40 million albums. Her multi-volume "songbooks" on Verve Records are among America's recording treasures.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia, singer Fitzgerald was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance "Tempie" Williams Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald experienced a troubled childhood that began with her parents separating shortly after her birth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her mother, Fitzgerald moved to Yonkers, New York. They lived there with her mother's boyfriend, Joseph Da Silva. The family grew in 1923 with the arrival of Fitzgerald's half-sister Frances. Struggling financially, the young Fitzgerald helped her family out by working as a messenger "running numbers" and acting as a lookout for a brothel. Her first career aspiration was to become a dancer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her mother's death in 1932, Fitzgerald ended up moving in with an aunt. She started skipping school. Fitzgerald was then sent to a special reform school but didn't stay there long.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1934, Fitzgerald was trying to make it on her own and living on the streets. Still harboring dreams of becoming an entertainer, she entered an amateur contest at Harlem's Apollo Theater.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the contest, she sang the Hoagy Carmichael tune "Judy" as well as "The Object of My Affection," wowing the audience. Fitzgerald went on to win the contest's $25 first-place prize.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That unexpected performance at the Apollo helped set Fitzgerald's career in motion. She soon met bandleader and drummer Chick Webb and eventually joined his group as a singer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fitzgerald recorded "Love and Kisses" with Webb in 1935 and found herself playing regularly at one of Harlem's hottest clubs, the Savoy. Fitzgerald also put out her first No. 1 hit, 1938's "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," which she co-wrote. Later that year, Fitzgerald recorded her second hit, "I Found My Yellow Basket."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to her work with Webb, Fitzgerald performed and recorded with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/benny-goodman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Benny Goodman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Benny Goodman</a> Orchestra. She had her own side project, too, known as Ella Fitzgerald and Her Savoy Eight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following Webb's death in 1939, Fitzgerald became the leader of the band, which was renamed Ella Fitzgerald and Her Famous Orchestra. (Some sources refer to the group as Ella Fitzgerald and Her Famous Band.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, Fitzgerald was briefly married to Ben Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer and hustler. They wed in 1941, but she soon had their union annulled.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rising Star</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Going out on her own, Fitzgerald landed a deal with Decca Records. She recorded some hit songs with the Ink Spots and Louis Jordan in the early 1940s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fitzgerald also made her film debut as Ruby in 1942's comedy western Ride 'Em Cowboy with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Her career really began to take off in 1946 when she started working with Norman Granz, the future founder of Verve Records.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the mid-1940s, Granz had started Jazz at the Philharmonic, a series of concerts and live records featuring most of the genre's great performers. Fitzgerald also hired Granz to become her manager.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, Fitzgerald went on tour with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dizzy-gillespie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dizzy Gillespie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dizzy Gillespie</a> and his band. She started changing her singing style, incorporating scat singing during her performances.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fitzgerald also fell in love with Gillespie's bass player Ray Brown. The pair wed in 1947, and they adopted a child born to Fitzgerald's half-sister whom they named Raymond "Ray" Brown Jr. The marriage ended in 1952.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">First Lady of Song</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 1950s and 1960s proved to be a time of great critical and commercial success for Fitzgerald, and she earned the moniker "First Lady of Song" for her mainstream popularity and unparalleled vocal talents. Her unique ability to mimic instrumental sounds helped popularize the vocal improvisation of scatting, which became her signature technique.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1956, Fitzgerald began recording for the newly created Verve. She made some of her most popular albums for the label, starting out with 1956's Ella Fitzgerald Sings the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/cole-porter data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cole Porter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cole Porter</a> Song Book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the very first Grammy Awards in 1958, Fitzgerald picked up her first two Grammys — and made history as the first African American woman to win the award — for best individual jazz performance and best female vocal performance for the two songbook projects Ella Fitzgerald Sings the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/duke-ellington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Duke Ellington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Duke Ellington</a> Song Book and Ella Fitzgerald Sings the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/irving-berlin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Irving Berlin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Irving Berlin</a> Song Book, respectively. (She worked directly with Ellington on the former album.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A truly collaborative soul, Fitzgerald produced great recordings with such artists as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/louis-armstrong data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Louis Armstrong" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Louis Armstrong</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/count-basie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Count Basie" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Count Basie</a>. She also performed several times with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/frank-sinatra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Frank Sinatra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Frank Sinatra</a> over the years as well.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1960, Fitzgerald broke into the pop charts with her rendition of "Mack the Knife." She was still going strong well into the 1970s, playing concerts across the globe. One especially memorable concert series from this time was a two-week engagement in New York City in 1974 with Sinatra and Basie.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the 1980s, Fitzgerald experienced serious health problems. She had heart surgery in 1986 and had been suffering from diabetes. The disease left her blind, and she had both legs amputated in 1994.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She made her last recording in 1989 and her last public performance in 1991 at New York's Carnegie Hall. Fitzgerald died on June 15, 1996, at her home in Beverly Hills.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In all, Fitzgerald recorded more than 200 albums and some 2,000 songs in her lifetime. Her total record sales exceeded 40 million. Her many accolades included 13 Grammy Awards, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/naacp data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NAACP class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">NAACP</a> Image Award for Lifetime Achievement and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While some critics complained that her style and voice lacked the depth of some her more bluesy counterparts, her success and the respect she garnered from the biggest names in the music industry showed that Fitzgerald was in a class all her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mel Torme described her as "the High Priestess of Song" and Pearl Bailey called her "the greatest singer of them all," according to Fitzgerald's official website. And <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bing-crosby data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bing Crosby" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bing Crosby</a> once said, "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest of them all."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since her passing, Fitzgerald has been honored and remembered in many ways. The United States Postal Service honored the late singer with a commemorative stamp celebrating the 90th anniversary of her birth.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, the tribute album We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song featured such artists as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/gladys-knight data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gladys Knight" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gladys Knight</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/etta-james data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Etta James" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Etta James</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/queen-latifah data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Latifah " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Queen Latifah </a>performing some of Fitzgerald's classics.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Quotes</h2><ul data-node-id=37 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>It isn’t where you came from, its where you’re going that counts.</li><li>I sing like I feel.</li><li>I stole everything I ever heard, but mostly I stole from the horns.</li><li>Coming through the years, and finding that I not only have just the fans of my day, but the young ones of today—that’s what it means, it means it was worth all of it.</li><li>The only thing better than singing is more singing.</li><li>Just don’t give up trying to do what you really want to do.
