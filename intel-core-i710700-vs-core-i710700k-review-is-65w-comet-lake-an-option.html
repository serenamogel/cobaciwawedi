With Civilization 6 however, Firaxis went hardcore on visual fidelity, trying to pull you into the game. As a result, Civilization can taxing on graphics and CPUs as we crank up the details, especially in DirectX 12.</p><p>For this benchmark, we are using the following settings:</p><ul><li>480p Low, 1440p Low, 4K Low, 1080p Max</li></ul><p>For automation, Firaxis supports the in-game automated benchmark from the command line, and output a results file with frame times. We do as many runs within 10 minutes per resolution/setting combination, and then take averages and percentiles.</p><p align=center><img id=120567 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16343/120567.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>All of our benchmark results can also be found in our benchmark engine, <a href=#>Bench</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH53f5NsZqKmpJq5bq%2FOq5xmoWdmfXh8j2atrGWTpL%2BmechwaGlvYGW4br7Er6Cer12ewG6ClLBknKedmsFuuMCknGaZnmK8scDIqKVoaWE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-christian-laettner-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Christian Laettner? | Wiki, Age, Bio, Net Worth, Career, Relationship,Family</span></a>
