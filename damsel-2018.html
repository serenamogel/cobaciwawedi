<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Damsel movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2018)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Pattinson’s Samuel Alabaster is one of them. In choosing once again to work with challenging directors, following <a href=#>David Cronenberg</a> (“<a href=#>Cosmopolis</a>”), <a href=#>James Gray</a> (“<a href=#>The Lost City of Z</a>”) and the Safdie brothers (“<a href=#>Good Time</a>”), Pattinson continues to erase all traces of pretty-boy vampirism from his repertoire. Here, he plays a love-struck man on the prairie who seems so guileless and goodhearted, it’s as if he’s emotionally stunted. This is a guy who takes dainty sips from a shot glass of whiskey at a saloon full of misfits because he has a delicate stomach. But as his elaborate scheme unravels, he reveals more complex layers underneath.</p><p>It’s around the year 1870 in the American West. The wealthy Samuel has trekked across the country to marry the woman he loves, whose picture he holds dear inside a locket. Her name is Penelope, and she is theoretically waiting for him. “She’s the most precious thing in the world,” Samuel rhapsodizes. “She’s like a flower.” The earnest tune he’s written for her—titled “Honey Bun,” which he sings in its agonizing entirety—is the treacly stuff of idealistic adolescence.</p><p>Working with cinematographer <a href=#>Adam Stone</a>, a frequent Jeff Nicholas collaborator, the Zellners paint a picture of vast possibility in their textured widescreen images of the frontier. But then the first time we see Samuel, he’s pulling a rowboat up to a misty, rocky shore. He opens the crate he’s brought with him and out walks a miniature, cream-colored horse. It’s like something out of a mystical fairy tale, and it’s an indication that we should probably toss out all our expectations as to what Westerns are usually about.</p><p>But Samuel and his tiny, adorable horse—whose name is Butterscotch, in case you were wondering—can’t make the journey alone. He also needs a preacher to perform the marriage. He finds that person—sort of—in David Zellner’s Parson Henry, who isn’t exactly a parson, as we’ve learned from the film’s hilariously deadpan opening scene. Then again, Penelope perhaps isn’t the precious flower Samuel has painted her to be, either.</p><p>In Wasikowska’s hands, Penelope is a bad-ass, no-nonsense frontier woman. She drinks and curses, smokes a pipe and fires a shotgun at strangers who dare to come near her. She isn’t interested in being swept off her feet and she definitely does not need saving—especially not by a man. But that’s exactly what keeps happening over and over again, as a series of men insist they know what’s best for her out of a sense of chivalry or egomania or a toxic combination of the two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dmKarlaF6c3yQcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christine-lagardes-net-worth-age-height-weight-boyfriend-dating-kids-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Christine Lagardes Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
