Next time around, things are going to run a bit different, because Triple H is behind the wheel.</p><p>The <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> noted that this year, for the first time, the Hall of Fame falls under Triple H, marking a departure from the traditional oversight of Vince McMahon. While the foundational principles for induction likely remain unchanged, there may be subtle shifts under Triple H’s direction.</p><p>It was suggested that the selection process could still be influenced by political considerations, particularly if Nick Khan advocates for a particular candidate. However, the Hall of Fame ultimately falls under the creative domain, and Triple H calls the shots.</p><p>“Regarding the Hall of Fame, this year will fall under Levesque for the first time instead of McMahon. It’s likely still the same basic rules regarding women, minorities and characters that the audience would know and those who make sense politically for a variety of reasons. I think Levesque may be a little more open to certain types since he was a fan of more than just WWE but once WWE owned the tape libraries a lot of that stigma was gone. I was told that, for example, if there is a political reason to put someone in that Nick Khan would want, that would be a factor but the Hall of Fame is under creative and that’s Levesque’s department and he’d in theory sign off on everyone.”</p><p>Triple H is known for his broader appreciation of wrestling beyond WWE, so it will be interesting to see who he picks.</p><p>WWE fans are discussing possible inductions in a big way, i<a href=#>ncluding Bray Wyatt’s possible induction</a>. As of this writing, no name has been made official, but everyone will have Triple H’s stamp of approval before they are announced.</p><p>Vince McMahon had his own way of doing things, but that is in the past. Now, Triple H is going to do his own thing, and next year’s WWE Hall of Fame will be historic for many reasons.</p><p>What’s your take on Triple H making calls for the 2024 WWE Hall of Fame?
