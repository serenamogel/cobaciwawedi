Her incredible strength and lengthy feud with Becky Lynch showcased her growth as a wrestler and sports entertainer. From losing in 26 seconds at <a href=#>SummerSlam 2021</a> to stealing the show at WrestleMania 38, Bianca has become one of WWE's most reliable performers, deserving of high recognition. WrestleMania 39 could help her start to build a generational path as a champion and wrestler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-asuka-should-win-asuka-has-never-beaten-bianca-on-the-main-roster><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Asuka Should Win: Asuka Has Never Beaten Bianca On The Main Roster</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bianca-Belair-v-Becky-Lynch-v-Asuka-Hell-in-a-Cell-2022-Cropped-1.jpg><p>Bianca and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asuka</a> have only had two televised matches on the main roster in the WWE. They have one draw and Bianca holds a victory from their match on Raw in 2022. Asuka is already a future WWE Hall of Famer, but she will likely not want to leave the WWE without at least one major victory over Belair who she started facing all the way back in NXT.</p><h2 id=why-bianca-belair-should-retain-their-storyline-is-uninteresting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Bianca Belair Should Retain: Their Storyline Is Uninteresting</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bianca-belair-v-asuka-cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The battle between Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch was worthy of its spot in WrestleMania. Many argue that it was one of the best matches of the entire WrestleMania 38 show. The same can't be said for the buildup between Asuka and the EST.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Bizarre Hometowns In WWE History</a></span></p><p>The match seems to be thrown together out of nowhere since few competitors seem worthy of Bianca's crown.

Somehow, Asuka hasn't won a Women's Title match at WrestleMania. Asuka has competed in four WreslteManias but was bested by <a href=#>Rhea Ripley</a> and Charlotte Flair every time she competed for either the Raw or SmackDown title.

Rockin' Robin's 502-day reign is the second-longest. However, if Bianca can hold on to her title through September of 2023, she will break that record. The competition in WWE's women's division is fierce, but a win at WrestleMania could help Bianca become an all-time great both in the ring and on the stat sheet. Becky held the Women's Champion 398 days during her first reign and this could also be toppled.</p><h2 id=why-asuka-should-win-it-could-set-up-a-great-feud><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Asuka Should Win: It Could Set Up A Great Feud</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/wwe-asuka-elimination-chamber-bianca-belair-wwe-raw-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Bianca Belair and Asuka have not been set up as foes in a great storyline, a defeat at WrestleMania could help launch a major rivalry between the two. Both wrestlers compete at the highest level and a long feud between the two could produce some massive matches in 2023.</p><p>As it stands, a win for Belair would not do much to help establish a deep feud between the two. A win for Asuka could even help ground Bianca Belair as a star in the same way her loss to <a href=#>Becky Lynch</a> helped elevate her character. There are endless great feud opportunities if Asuka wins the title.</p><h2 id=why-bianca-belair-should-retain-would-become-the-first-woman-to-successfully-leave-wrestlemania-as-world-champion-three-times-in-a-row><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Why Bianca Belair Should Retain: Would Become The First Woman To Successfully Leave WrestleMania As World Champion Three Times In A Row</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bianca-Belair-v-Sasha-Banks-WrestleMania-37-Cropped-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with possibly becoming the longest reigning Women's Champion of this generation, Bianca is on course to other major milestones.

Asuka's biggest win at Mania was a WWE Women's Tag Team Title match.
