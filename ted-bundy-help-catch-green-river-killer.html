The word on the street was that they would be lured into a car by a man named Ted who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-ted-bundys-brutal-crimes/story?id=61077236" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pretended to be injured" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">pretended to be injured</a> with his arm in a sling, needing their help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bundy later moved to Utah for law school, where he was caught. He eventually escaped from prison and ended up in Tallahassee, Florida — continuing to kill wherever he went.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ironically Ridgway was born in Utah on February 18, 1949, but also raised in Washington state, near Seattle’s SeaTac airport. Before graduating high school, he joined the Navy and was sent to Vietnam.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When he returned, he started painting trucks — and around 1982, runaways and prostitutes started disappearing off of State Route 99 in Washington's King County. He tended to bring them to his home, strangle them and then dispose of their bodies in the woods, which is how several ended washing up along the nearby Green River.</p><img alt="Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer" title="Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer" width=3000 height=2355 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2821018.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Gary Ridgway prepares to leave the courtroom where he was sentenced to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>48 life sentences without the possibility of parole&lt;/em>&amp;nbsp;on December 18, 2003, in Seattle, Washington.; Photo: Josh Trujillo-Pool/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Bundy offered his assistance from death row</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1986, a detective named Dave Reichert had been working on the Green River case for years. Despite 40 female victims, he still didn’t have any reliable leads, when he got a fascinating offer to help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Don't ask me why I believe I'm an expert in this area, just accept that I am and we'll start from there,” Bundy wrote to Reichert from a Florida jail, where he was on death row. Bundy had been reading about the Green River Killer and saw Reichert’s photo in stories, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/07/us/21-year-hunt-for-killer-shapes-man-and-family.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to the New York Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the time, Bundy had already been imprisoned for six years and was waiting for this death sentence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reichert flew to Florida with fellow investigator Robert Keppel, who was an investigator on Bundy’s case. According to Keppel's book, The Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer, he says that Bundy had reached out to him — and that he was the only one the convicted killer would talk to.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://allthatsinteresting.com/gary-ridgway-ted-bundy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reports say" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">reports say</a> that at some point, Bundy suggested that the Green River Killer — who he called “Riverman” — might be going back to the sites he left the bodies and performing sexual acts and suggested that the detectives stake out fresh burial sites.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“The sheriff [Reichert], who spent three days interviewing Mr. Ridgway alone, said he quickly realized that serial killers have a lot in common, whether they kill prostitutes, as Mr. Ridgway and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/jack-the-ripper data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack the Ripper" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jack the Ripper</a> did, young boys, as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/john-wayne-gacy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Wayne Gacy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Wayne Gacy</a> did, or young women, as Mr. Bundy did,” the New York Times story said. “Both Mr. Bundy, who was put to death for the murder of three women and had confessed to killing at least 16 others, and Mr. Ridgway were sexual predators who killed during or after sexually assaulting or having sex with their victims.”</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Investigators felt both killers had 'no remorse'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The information that Bundy provided helped the investigators get inside the mind of a killer — especially one who knew the Washington area well — and eventually they did capture Ridgway in 2001.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“First off, there's no remorse,” Reichert told the New York Times of the serial killer mindset. “He doesn't have any feelings toward anybody, his family included. And that's what I saw in Bundy and what I saw in Ridgway.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reichert also said that Bundy would tell him actions he expected Ridgway to do, but in reality, they were veiled confessions of things Bundy had already performed. “It was as if Mr. Bundy was jealous of the attention the Green River killer was getting,” Reichert hypothesized.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both killers also were proud of their actions. As the Times continued: “Like Mr. Bundy, Sheriff Reichert said, Mr. Ridgway craved attention and control and was prideful when discussing his killings. When detectives presented him with an unsolved murder to see if he would confess it, he told them: ‘Why, if it isn't mine? Because I have pride in...what I do. I don't wanna take it from anybody else.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bundy died in an execution chair nicknamed Old Sparky on January 24, 1989, at the Florida State Prison, as crowds cheered outside. Ridgway was sentenced to life in prison in 2003, having reportedly committed more murders than any serial killer in U.S. history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6Gdmny1scNmma6mlK56qbHLqWScmaSYtW6z0Z6cp2WinsOmvoykoKWklac%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elisha-cuthbert-has-confirmed-her-pregnancy.html><span>←</span><span>Elisha Cuthbert Has Confirmed Her Pregnancy</span></a>
