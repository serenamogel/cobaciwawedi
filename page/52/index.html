[Verse 1]
Checked out and waiting for the weekend
Coked up it's alright I'm leaving
I don't want to go back home
Skip school I'm already failing
Tell mom and dad that I'm bailing
Now we're driving up the coast[Verse 2]
Fucked up and sleepless in Seattle
Got drunk and barfed in my shadow
I don't ever want to go
Got high and ended up in Portland
But you can't buy liquor in Oregon</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Albert Mohler Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Wife, Net Worth, Briefing, Sermons and Social Justice</h2><time>Apr 10, 2024</time>

I was new to the idea of blogs, but suddenly I spent all my time at the office procrastinating instead of working.
