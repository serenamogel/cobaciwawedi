Although willing to try, plenty of folks aren’t quite sure why the house of mouse is making so many live action remakes to begin with — and we can’t blame them.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Still, that hasn’t stopped Disney from trying, and along the way a few films have been produced that are straight-up nightmare fuel. We’re looking at you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lion King</a>. Seriously. Who thought that was a good idea? Now, as The Little Mermaid swims swiftly toward it’s May 26 release date, it seems a whole new crop of beloved animated characters are looking a little worse for ware. Enter Sebastian the singing crab. Oh, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flounder</a> is here too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>First posters for Sebastian and Flounder in ‘THE LITTLE MERMAID’. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kN9h8pEXWf</a></p>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href=#>April 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Since the house of mouse decided to release these official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">character posters yesterday on Twitter</a>, the internet has been buzzing.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>On one hand, you’ve got to commend the studio for at least trying to make these iconic characters work. On the other, there’s certainly something eerie about these two. Photorealistic animals in a live action, CGI remake can cause problems mainly because they lack any ability to emote. They can’t express themselves, and in turn, audiences aren’t able to engage.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Bringing up The Lion King again sends shivers down our spine, but take Simba for example: He sings a song? Frowny face. His dad dies? Frowny face. He reclaims his rightful place as king? You get the picture.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>It’s true that condemning a movie before it hits theaters is poor form, but when it comes to our boy Sebastian, he just doesn’t look right. Amidst all the chaos one questions has floated to the surface our collective subconscious: What kind of crab is he?</p><h2 id=h-what-kind-of-crab-is-sebastian-in-the-little-mermaid data-injectable=false>What kind of crab is Sebastian in The Little Mermaid?</h2><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>As far as Sebastian is concerned, the little guy is in fact a tropical ghost crab — which makes things a bit complicated because ghost crabs, you know, drown. That’s right, these critters can’t survive underwater.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait…</p><p>Little Mermaid's Sebastian is now a ghost crab, a type that can't survive underwater? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/e8vAN9wCUr</a></p>— ThatUmbrellaGuy (@ThatUmbrella) <a href=#>March 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>This worst part about this whole ordeal is that they could have chosen so many types of crab that do just find out at sea. The only saving grace is that The Little Mermaid is, well, about mermaids.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>With all the magic, secret kingdoms, and octopus/human hybrids we’re bound to see before the credits roll— the last thing anyone should be worrying about is whether or not Sebastian is the right kind of crab. The silver lining in all of this is that an actor like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daveed Diggs</a> is lending his golden pipes to the role. That in mind, and with any luck, The Little Mermaid could still surprise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK4qrrDZqafZZOnrqN5yKxkrJ2SlsC1tcCnZKKmXam1pnnLoqutpJViuqa%2BzJqgnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-neal.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Neal</span></a>
