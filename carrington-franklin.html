Her half-sisters and half-brothers are Kennedy and Caziah, respectively, and her step-brother is Kerrion.</p><p>Kerrion, Kirk’s previous relationship’s child, has previously drawn media attention due to his estranged relationship with his father. Kerrion shocked his fans and followers in June 2018 when he claimed that his own father, Kirk Franklin, was attempting to murder him. While it has been more than two years since he sent the now-deleted tweet and Kerrion is in good health, his relationship with his father remains strained.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW71040573 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW71040573 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW71040573 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Carrington has a massive social media reach because she is constantly active on her socials.
