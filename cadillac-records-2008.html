<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Cadillac Records movie review (2008)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>"Cadillac Records" is an account of the Chess story that depends more on music than history, which is perhaps as it should be. The film is a fascinating record of the evolution of a black musical style, and the tangled motives of the white men who had an instinct for it. The Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil, walked into neighborhoods that were dicey for white men after midnight, packed firearms, found or were found by the most gifted musicians of the emerging urban music, and recorded them in a studio so small it forced the sound out into the world.</p><p>This movie sidesteps the existence of Phil Chess, now living in Arizona, and focuses on the enigmatic, chain-smoking Leonard (<a href=#>Adrien Brody</a>). Starting with an early liaison with Muddy Waters, who in effect became his creative partner, he visited "race music" radio stations in the South with his artists and payola, found and/or created a demand, and gave his musicians shiny new Cadillacs but never a good look at their royalties. Muddy (<a href=#>Jeffrey Wright</a>) was probably paid only a share of the money he earned, but the more ferocious Howlin' Wolf (<a href=#>Eamonn Walker</a>), seemingly less sophisticated, held onto his money, made his own deals and incredibly even paid health benefits for the members of his band.</p><p>It is part of the legend that Muddy was nice, Howlin' was scary, and they disliked each other. In the film, they are guarded but civil, and fierce competitors. Walker plays the 6-foot-4 Wolf as a scowler who somehow from that height looks up at people under hooded eyes and appears willing to slice you just for the convenience. The real Howlin' Wolf must have been more complex; he couldn't read or write until he was past 40, but then he earned his high school equivalency diploma and studied accounting, an excellent subject for an associate of Leonard Chess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cmJ2hnKGupHnRnpqoqpSoenN8j3E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marty-york.html><span>←</span><span>Marty York</span></a>
