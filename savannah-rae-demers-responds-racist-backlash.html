Because of a now-deleted video she posted during the Amazon Prime event in July this year, Savannah Rae Demers is facing criticism from her followers.
She was seen with her companion in the now-deleted video, wrapping a pink blanket around their heads and holding up her phone to reveal the scenario.
A lady with a hijab was in the background, and as Demers raised her phone to show up the surroundings, she and her friend laughed off, which felt offensive as some of her fans claimed that she made fun of the lady with hijab."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
