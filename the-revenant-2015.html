<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Revenant movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Iñárritu and co-writer <a href=#>Mark L. Smith</a> set their tone early, staging a breathtaking assault on a group of fur trappers by Native Americans, portrayed not just as “enemies” but a violent force of nature. While a few dozen men are preparing to pack up and move on to their next stop in the great American wilderness, a scene out of “<a href=#>Apocalypse Now</a>” unfolds. Arrows pierce air and flesh as the few surviving men flee to a nearby boat. It turns out that the tribe is seeking a kidnapped daughter of its leader, and will kill anyone who gets in their way. At the same time, we learn that one of the trappers, Hugh Glass (<a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>) has a half-Native American son named Hawk (Forrest Goodluck).</p><p>Low on men and hunted, the expedition leader Andrew Henry (<a href=#>Domhnall Gleeson</a>) orders that their crew return to its base, a fort in the middle of this snowy wilderness. <a href=#>John Fitzgerald</a> (Tom Hardy) disagrees, and the seeds of dissent are planted. He doesn’t trust Henry, and he doesn’t like Glass. In the midst of these discussions, Glass is away from the crew one day when he’s brutally attacked by a bear—the sequence is, without hyperbole, one of the most stunning things I’ve seen on film in a long time, heart-racing and terrifying. Glass barely survives the attack. It seems highly unlikely that he’ll make it back to the base. With increasingly dangerous conditions and a tribe of killers on their heels, they agree to split up. Most of the men will go back first while Fitzgerald, Hawk and a young man named Bridger (<a href=#>Will Poulter</a>) will get a sizable fee to stay with Glass until he dies, giving him as much comfort as possible in his final days and the burial he deserves.</p><p>Of course, Fitzgerald quickly tires of having to watch a man he doesn’t care about die. He kills Hawk in front of an immobile Glass and then basically buries Hugh alive. As Bridger and Fitzgerald head back, Glass essentially rises from the dead (the word revenant means “one that returns after death or a long absence”) and begins his quest for vengeance. With broken bones, no food, and miles to go, he pulls himself through snow and across mountains, seeking the man who killed his son. He is practically a ghost, a man who has come as close to death as one possibly can but is unwilling to go to the other side until justice is done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55loprDprrAp6tmamBmgg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophie-piteo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-693527-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sophie Piteo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
