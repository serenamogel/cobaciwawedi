She had suffered a massive seizure and&nbsp;cardiac arrest. The mum-of-three was rushed to a Turkish hospital and put in a coma. A total of £50,000 was then raised to bring Melissa back home – but she was pronounced dead just hours after landing back in&nbsp;Merseyside.</p><p>Melissa’s mum Michelle Heathcote, 51, has since spoken of the devastation the loss has caused her family. She said: “My four-year-old granddaughter keeps asking ‘why can’t heaven just give her medicine and send her back?’ It was Melissa’s birthday last week and we took balloons and flowers to a memorial bench. It really upset her older daughters. I think it hit them that their mummy won’t be coming back.”</p><p>Michelle said the family has endured a battle to find out how the previously healthy mum died so suddenly. Two months after Melissa’s death her cousin Nicole Waters received test results which confirmed she has Long QT Syndrome – a genetic heart condition. Tests on Melissa, from Moreton in Wirral, later showed she had the same condition, with Michelle revealing Nicole’s test results – which took seven months to process –&nbsp;might well have saved her daughter’s life.</p><p>Michelle said: “I couldn’t believe it had taken seven months for Nicole’s test results to be processed.&nbsp;NHMichelle said the family has endured a battle to find out how the previously healthy mum died so suddenly.

NHS guidelines advise they ought to take around three months. If they had come back during the recommended time frame, Melissa would have been tested and either prescribed medication or fitted with a pacemaker. She could have been saved. Instead, Melissa has lost her life at such a young age, she had so much to look forward to. We have lost our only child, Jay has lost his partner, and most tragically of all, three little girls are left without a mummy.” guidelines advise they ought to take around three months.
