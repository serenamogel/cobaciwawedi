YOU LEGEND.😂🙌,” the England native, 31, captioned a clip from their big scene via Instagram on Wednesday, June 14. <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong> </a>“liked” the post.</p><p>During their appearance on the Tuesday, June 13, episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Hamm, 52, played Kennedy while Slattery, 60, portrayed <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a> as they read dialogue from a <a href=#>recent Pump Rules episode</a>. The Emmy winner fully committed to the role, adding a British accent and even emulating the DJ’s body language.</p><p>Kennedy took it all in stride. “This is crazy I love Jon Hamm. What a legend 😂😂😂😂,” he added via Instagram Story on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p>While Hamm knew how to imitate Kennedy immediately — reciting his “you’re worm with a mustache” and “poo-poo head” insults to perfection — Slattery didn’t appear to be as big of a Bravo fan, questioning if he should have a British accent as well. (Sandoval, 40, is from Missouri.)</p><p>The Top Gun: Maverick actor is a big fan of several Bravo shows. He explained during his WWHL appearance that he has delved deeper into reality TV in recent years due to his connection with Cohen, 55.</p><p>“It all kind of washed over me. My entry point was you,” Hamm told the host. “‘Cause you’re a St. Louis homeboy, so there was that. But this last couple years, maybe the pandemic, proved a very fruitful time to dig deep into this stuff. The four shows I focus on are [Real Housewives of] New York, [Real Housewives of New] Jersey, Southern Charm and Vanderpump now. … I’m digging in with both hands.”</p><p>It’s a dramatic time to dive into Vanderpump Rules thanks to <a href=#>Scandoval</a>. The scene that Hamm and Slattery were reenacting came from Kennedy confronting Sandoval about the singer’s affair with Raquel Leviss.</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed in March</a> that Madix ended her nine-year relationship with Sandoval after learning he’d had a months-long fling with her friend behind her back.</p><p>The <a href=#>reunion</a> showed the entire cast confronting the secret lovers. When Sandoval began to shed tears, <a href=#>Kennedy accused him</a> of putting on an act.</p><p>“Pull yourself together man, you’re not at the Oscars,” Kennedy said. “You’re not at an audition. Be a man, pull yourself together. F–king crocodile tears, p–sy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He didn’t stop there. “You’re a clown. And you know what? Your band sucks d–k. You’re a nothing, you’re a nobody,” Kennedy said as he roasted his former friend. “You’re a loser and your bar is going down the drain, you backstabbing hoe.”</p><p>What What Happens Live With Andy Cohen airs on Bravo Sundays through Thursdays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGapZWoeqyxzaecnbFdp7Kir9OsZK2nXZ%2B8r3nHmqSmq12euqrAwK2gqKZdpLNutMimZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-frozen-soup-dumplings.html><span>←</span><span>Best Frozen Soup Dumplings [Taste Test]</span></a>
