100 miles per hour and had a blood-alcohol concentration of .197 — more than twice the legal limit of .08.</p><p>Bowles’ lawyers said she is being retaliated against for her lawsuit.</p><figure

along with punitive damages.</p><p>The suit claims the Georgia athletic association entrusted a rented SUV to LeCroy and was aware that she had at least two “super speeder” violations among four speeding tickets prior to the crash.</p><p>The athletic association said staff members were authorized to use rental vehicles for recruiting purposes only.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image

circumstances were recruiting staff authorized to use rental cars to drive at excessive speeds while intoxicated,” the athletic association said in a statement.</p><p>Bowles was on paid medical leave for a couple of months following the crash, before the athletic association placed her on unpaid leave in March, according to records obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p><p>Rob Buck, an attorney representing Bowles in her lawsuit, said the university has engaged in a “campaign of intimidation” against his client, whose job paid less than $12,000 a year.</p><p>“Tory, like all other perceived liabilities to the football program, became expendable to UGA, and despite her loyalty and meager salary, has been steamrolled,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image

said the dismissal was retaliatory. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The athletic association said in a statement Monday that while it wished Bowles well in her recovery, it was forced to fire her for lack of cooperation.</p><p>“Applicable policies require university employees to cooperate with internal investigations,” the statement obtained by the Journal-Constitution said. “Over the course of several months, Ms. Bowles was asked — on numerous occasions — to speak with our investigators and provide information, and through her attorney, she repeatedly refused to cooperate.</p><p>“As a result, we were ultimately left with no choice but to terminate her employment.”</p><p>Carter received 12 months’ probation and a $1,000 fine in March after <a href=#>pleading no contest to misdemeanor charges</a> of reckless driving and racing.</p><p>McClendon was a fifth-round pick by the Rams.</p><p>– With AP.</p><p class=postsid
