<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>When Will I Be Loved movie review (2004)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The count suggests an introduction. Ford mentions money. Money is not a problem. The count is a man of the world, cultivated, with taste but without scruples. He would never make the mistake of implying that cash will be exchanged for sex. He uses the soothing language of money as a gift or tribute or simply a gesture, as if Vera deserves his money because she is so splendid a person.</p><p>Ford pitches the idea to Vera, after a scene in which they have enthusiastic sex; Vera has earlier had spontaneous sex with a girlfriend, and is a thoroughly sensual creature. We begin to understand why she is attracted to Ford, why she even likes him, why she's entertained by the audacity of his pitch to the world. But Ford is poor and needs money, and pushes too hard in the wrong way.</p><p>Vera agrees to meet with the count, as much for her own amusement as anything. She quickly ups the talking price from $100,000 to $1 million -- both sums negligible to the count. She discovers that Ford, as the middle-man, was going to cheat her on her share. She is dealing with a man who wants to sell her and another who wants to buy her, and neither one understands two things: (1) she is offended by being bought and sold, and (2) she doesn't need the money.</p><p>Toback began as a writer ("<a href=#>The Gambler</a>") before going on to write and direct such films as "Fingers" and "<a href=#>Black and White</a>" and write "<a href=#>Bugsy</a>" for <a href=#>Warren Beatty</a>. In his work and in his life, he likes risk, likes gambling, likes women, and once tried to pick up so many in a short span of time that the late Spy magazine ran a four-page fold-out chart of who he hit on, what he told them, and how he scored. There's a little Ford in his character, but also a little of Vera and the count, especially in his delight in verbal negotiation.</p><p>The centerpiece of the film is an extended scene between Vera and the count, as they discuss the amount of money and what it is being paid for. Vera is very specific about the money and the count is politely vague about exactly what he expects for it, until Vera makes it clear that the count is likely to be pleased with the outcome. It is possible that Vera might have gone through with the deal, not for $1 million but for the danger, excitement and audacity of negotiating for the $1 million and then delivering; the count is not young, but he is trim, elegant, sophisticated, and probably good company -- at dinner, you know, and the opera, and at what he means when he mentions dinner and the opera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wn56mXay2rbiMomSbnV2hvLexw2ZpaWhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-language-do-brazilians-speak.html><span>←</span><span>Qu idioma hablan los brasileos?
