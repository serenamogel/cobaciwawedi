I took a screenshot of the comment, posted it on my Instagram Stories, and tagged him, saying, “Marco, if you want to make this girl $300, DM me.” He had over 4 million followers at the time, and I only had 500,000. I was like, He’s not going to see this. But he replied, like, a second later. So I sent the girl $300 and he came on the podcast. Our video together got so many views, and Drake Liked it. Then he followed me.”</p><p>“I decided to just go for it and shoot my shot,” she said. “I DMed Drake and asked if he wanted to be on my podcast, and he said yes. He sent me his touring schedule, and I knew that I needed to make it happen fast, so my friend and I flew to Memphis two days after the original DM was sent to record the episode.”</p><p>As a young mother, she also described how it was the first time she had to travel without her kids, “It was my first time ever leaving my kids overnight. And Drake posted a picture that we took that night and you can see the cords of my pump. I was over there just, like, pumping and stuff.” She continued, “We celebrated her birthday the weekend before, and she’s 1. She doesn’t know anything. It’s like any other day to her. People are so dramatic. They were like, You did this for Drake? I don’t even know what my parents did for my 1st birthday. They probably worked. I know that I’m a good mom. It was work, and it was very much needed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBqJmboV2WubW0zp%2BdZpyilrimew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./netflix-wont-air-dave-chappelles-hollywood-bowl-set.html><span>←</span><span>Netflix wont air Dave Chappelles Hollywood Bowl set</span></a>
