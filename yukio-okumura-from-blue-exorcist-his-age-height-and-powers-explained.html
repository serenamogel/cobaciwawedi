By the time the anime’s story begins, the teenager has already ascended to the status of Exorcist, being the youngest person to have ever passed the required examination. To top it off, he’s also a teacher at True Cross Academy, conducting classes that his older brother attends. Throughout Blue Exorcist, the brown-haired, bespectacled prodigy proves his worth time and again, exhibiting great intelligence, pragmatism, and courage while doing so.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>To put it plainly, Yukio is a fascinating character who’s perhaps even more interesting than his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blue-flame-sword-wielding</a> sibling, even though his arc is relegated to secondary status in Blue Exorcist. Such being the case, there are many facts that Blue Exorcist fans are eager to learn about him, such as what his age, height, and powers happen to be.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-tall-and-strong-is-yukio data-injectable=false>How old, tall, and strong is Yukio?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Yukio-and-Rin-as-children-1.jpg><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>So far in Blue Exorcist, Yukio’s age has gone from 15 to 16 (accompanied by his twin brother’s, who shares the same birthday). That makes his unusual achievements all the more impressive, wouldn’t you say?</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>As far as height is concerned, Blue Exorcist‘s secondary lead is a full 5’11” tall, making him three inches taller than his older brother, Rin, who stands at 5’8″.</p><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>Despite not having his sibling’s blue-flame power, Blue Exorcist‘s glasses-wearing genius has no shortage of strengths, and is a badass in his own right. For starters, he’s a first-rate Exorcist and martial arts expert. He’s also a proficient teacher, boasts significant medical knowledge, and manifests a flame-resistance ability, granting him an immunity to red, black, and blue fire. (In the anime, he eventually unlocks his own blue-flame power, but this isn’t canon.)</p><p data-characters=617 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=false>This isn’t all, either. By the mere age of 13, Yukio had already earned a Meister in Dragoon and Doctor, meaning that he can fight demons using firearms and herbs and potions, as well as heal the sick or injured with the latter two. He’s a skilled long-range shooter, often utilizing a pair of dual handguns in his battles and eventually acquiring The Armumahel Pistols’ prototype, which is capable of injuring Blue Exorcist‘s high-level demons. Also, despite lacking a Meister in Tamer, he displays the ability to summon water demons known as Naiads whilst fighting a demon. Impressive, huh?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6yrKShn2K8rMHMrqmaZZanvK55waWsnmWVrbyzr8isq2agmah6orPEZp%2BeoZedwW6tzZ1kqaenmr%2B0ecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-story-of-us-1999.html><span>←</span><span>The Story of Us movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1999)</span></a>
