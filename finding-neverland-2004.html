<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Finding Neverland movie review (2004)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Two other women regard this situation with alarm. Barrie's wife Mary (<a href=#>Radha Mitchell</a>) rarely sees him at home and is understandably disturbed about his relationship with the Davies family, although she is not as angry as she might be; there is the implication that she has long since given up on expecting rational behavior from her husband. He lives in a dream world, and to some degree she understands that. Not as sympathetic is Emma du Maurier (<a href=#>Julie Christie</a>), Sylvia's mother, who as the widow of the famous George du Maurier moved in sophisticated circles and is not amused by a 43-year-old man who wants to become the best playmate of her grandchildren.</p><p>It is Barrie's innocence, or naivete, or perhaps even a kind of rapture, impervious to common sense, that steers him past all obstacles as he begins to form the idea of "<a href=#>Peter Pan</a>" in his mind. The boys are his muses. He tries to explain his new play to his impresario, who has just closed one flop, doesn't want to open another, and is less than thrilled about a play involving fairies, pirates, and children who can fly. Depp in his scenes shows Barrie in the grip of a holy zeal, his mind operating on a private, almost trance-like level, as the play comes into focus for him. He knows, if nobody else does, that he is creating a myth that will powerfully involve children. His masterstroke is to invite 25 orphans to the play's opening night and scatter them through the audience, where their laugher and delight stirs the adults to see the magic in the play.</p><p>For Depp, "Finding Neverland" is the latest in an extraordinary series of performances. After his Oscar nomination for "Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003), here is another role that seems destined for nomination. And then think of his work in "<a href=#>Secret Window</a>" (2004), the <a href=#>Stephen King</a> story about the author caught in a nightmare, and his demented CIA agent in "<a href=#>Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a>" (2003), and wait until you see him in "<a href=#>The Libertine</a>," as the depraved and shameless Earl of Rochester. That the flamboyance of his pirate and the debauchery of the Earl could exist in the same actor as the soft-spoken, gentle, inward J.M. Barrie is remarkable. It is commonplace for actors to play widely differing roles, but Depp never makes it feel like a reach; all of these notes seem well within his range.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46foKecmaO0brrEr5yrpJGjsW5%2Bj2lr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bling-empire-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-61672-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bling Empire Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
