By age 11, she was on television, and by adolescence, in movies. Rossum combined her vocal and acting talents to become a star at 18 in the film adaptation of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a36866315/andrew-lloyd-webber data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andrew Lloyd Webber" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>'s The Phantom of the Opera.

Her father, a banker, was absent from her life. Despite not having siblings, she became a part of a much bigger family after joining the Children's Chorus of the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 7. The youngster found herself singing alongside the likes of Plácido Domingo and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a96296975/luciano-pavarotti data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Luciano Pavarotti" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Luciano Pavarotti</a>. The only drawback was that her career interfered with her education. After having to drop out of the prestigious all-girls Spence School in Manhattan, Rossum completed her high school education online instead, in a program funded by Stanford University.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Early TV and Film Career" data-anchor-id=early-tv-and-film-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early TV and Film Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Like many fledgling actresses, the classically trained singer got her television start on a daytime soap: At age 11, Emmy Rossum was featured on As the World Turns. A few more guest appearances on various dramas paved the way for her portrayal of a teenage <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a68659211/audrey-hepburn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Audrey Hepburn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Audrey Hepburn</a> in the ABC Original Movie The Audrey Hepburn Story in 2000.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rossum moved from the tube to an independent flick that same year, portraying an Appalachian orphan in Songcatcher. She was recognized for her work with a Spirit Award nomination. In 2003, when she finally broke into feature films, it was in a big way, with co-stars like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a90668815/kevin-bacon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Bacon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin Bacon</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a40976908/sean-penn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean Penn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean Penn</a> in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a11627790/clint-eastwood data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clint Eastwood" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Clint Eastwood</a>–directed movie Mystic River. The apocalyptic thriller The Day After Tomorrow was next, in 2004.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="'The Phantom of the Opera'" data-anchor-id=the-phantom-of-the-opera class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">'The Phantom of the Opera'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Next, Rossum lit up the screen in a role beyond perfect for her, as the opera-singing ingenue the 2004 film version of The Phantom of the Opera. Andrew Lloyd Webber personally picked her when she was just 16 to pair up with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/a92839439/gerard-butler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gerard Butler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gerard Butler</a>, who played the phantom. It proved a smart selection; not only did she shine in this musical, the actress earned a Golden Globe nomination, as well as the National Board of Review's award for best female breakthrough performance and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for best young actress—both in 2004—for her role in the production.That success was a springboard for Rossum to release two albums: Inside Out, in 2006, featuring songs she wrote; and Sentimental Journey, filled with standards, several years later.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="'Shameless' on TV" data-anchor-id=shameless-on-tv class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">'Shameless' on TV</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rossum returned to television in 2011, playing the antithesis of the demure role that made her famous in The Phantom of the Opera. On the critically acclaimed Showtime series Shameless, she stars as Fiona Gallagher, the eldest of six kids, who plays parent to her younger siblings as well as her drunken, dysfunctional dad (William H. Macy.) It's a racier role with plenty of nudity, which Rossum defends for making the show more realistic.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="Recent Films" data-anchor-id=recent-films class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Recent Films</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2013, Rossum starred as siren Ridley Duchannes in the supernatural drama/romance Beautiful Creatures. In 2014, she starred in the drama Before I Disappear, the indie rom-com Comet, and alongside Hilary Swank in You’re Not You.</p>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
