<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Fitzcarraldo movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1982)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Herzog finally settled on the right actor to play Fitzcarraldo, author of this plan: <a href=#>Klaus Kinski</a>, the shock-haired German who starred in Herzog's "<a href=#>Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a>" and "<a href=#>Nosferatu</a>," is back again to mastermind the effort. Kinski is perfectly cast. Herzog's original choice for the role was <a href=#>Jason Robards</a>, who is also gifted at conveying a consuming passion, but Kinski, wild-eyed and ferocious, consumes the screen. There are other characters important to the story, especially <a href=#>Claudia Cardinale</a> as the madam who loves Fitzcarraldo and helps finance his attempt, but without Kinski at the core it's doubtful this story would work.</p><p>The story of Herzog's own production is itself well-known, and has been told in Les Blank's "<a href=#>Burden of Dreams</a>," a brilliant documentary about the filming. It's possible that every moment of "Fitzcarraldo" is colored by our knowledge that Herzog was "really" doing the things we see Fitzcarraldo do. (The movie uses no special effects, no models, no opticals, no miniatures.) Perhaps we're even tempted to give the movie extra points because of Herzog's ordeal in the jungle.</p><p>But "Fitzcarraldo" is not all sweat and madness. It contains great poetic images of the sort Herzog is famous for: An old phonograph playing a Caruso record on the deck of a boat spinning out of control into a rapids; Fitzcarraldo frantically oaring a little rowboat down a jungle river to be in time to hear an opera; and of course the immensely impressive sight of that actual steamship, resting halfway up a hillside.</p><p>"Fitzcarraldo" is not a perfect movie, and it never comes together into a unified statement. It is meandering, and it is slow and formless at times. Perhaps the conception was just too large for Herzog to shape. The movie does not approach perfection as "Aguirre" did. But as a document of a quest and a dream, and as the record of man's audacity and foolish, visionary heroism, there has never been another movie like it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46foK2yk5a%2Fs63LnaZmaWltfw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bridget-williams-net-worth-131848.html><span>←</span><span>Bridget Williams Net Worth</span></a>
