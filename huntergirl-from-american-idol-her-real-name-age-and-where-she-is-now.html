It’s so much fun. Like, all of us in a van going to the shows and like loading the gear in and getting to meet the fans after the shows and having merch… I think just watching [my fans] respond to new songs has been so cool during the sets, and I’m just like, ‘Hey! This is a new song. I know y’all don’t know it,’ and they always hang on the ride… I’m really excited to put some of the songs out that I’ve been playing that are new on the road, and hopefully everybody likes them.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>If you are an American Idol fan and loved watching HunterGirl’s journey on season 20, be sure to connect with the rising country star on social media so you do not miss a single release from here on out.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>In addition to this, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for an official premiere date for season 22 of American Idol — springtime can’t come soon enough!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46hrKeslae0qr7LZp2rp51irq6x0aKamqZdnrGwuIyhnKtlopqurXnNmqSeZZGcsm6tzZ1ksKCVp7Juv8eeZKKrXaO8uHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chocolate-peanut-butter-ice-cream-cake.html><span>←</span><span>Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream Cake</span></a>
