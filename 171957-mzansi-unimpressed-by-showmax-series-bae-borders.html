Couldn't they come up with something like 'Catching Drug Dealers' or something that is contributing positively to our country?"<p class=align-left>@EmpireTDlu said:</p>"Hope it receives less ratings and viewership and get cancelled. Tired of these shows."<p class=align-left>@Kwena06019336 said:</p>"The showman dating show features 4 South African gullible females and 12 Nigerian males who are looking for an opportunity to get South African residence papers. None of the 12 will walk away on any principle because principles stay being put aside by Nigerians."<p class=align-left>@BekithembaZ added:</p>"This show falls in the pool of Twitter trends that lazy executives thought would make great television. MojaLove has a lot of this too. The show will trend because it is made for Twitter and clickbait. It will do nothing for South Africans or Nigerians."<p class=align-left>@naledimokgosi1</p>"I hear people crying about Moja Love’s portrayal of black people neh. But Showmax is trying its best to take the spot. Actually, MultiChoice as a whole nje seems to have an anti-black agenda. This is divisive like most of their shows are desperately trying to be."<h2>2 Local women accuse Showmax of theft</h2><p class=align-left>In a previous report from <strong>Briefly News</strong>, two South African women accused Showmax of <a href=#>stealing the concept of <i>Bae Beyond Borders</i></a><i>.</i></p><p class=align-left>Assuming that their accusations were true, Mzansi called Showmax out for alleged copyright infringement.
