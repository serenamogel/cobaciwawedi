Jay is a writer, comedian, actor, and director, probably best known for his work with the comedy group Broken Lizard. He has directed and starred in films such as “Club Dread”, “Beerfest”, and “Super Troopers”. All of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Jay Chandrasekhar? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $8 million, mostly earned through his work in acting and directing, having worked on numerous feature films and television shows. Apart from Broken Lizard, Jay is known to have directed episodes of various television shows. As he continues his career it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Jay Chandrasekhar Net Worth $8 million</h3><p>Jay attended Lake Forest Academy, and after matriculating would go to Colgate University, graduating with a degree in European history and a minor in philosophy. While in college, he also spent a semester at Loyola University. Jay would then become part of the Film Production program of New York University – Tisch School.</p><p>Chandrasekhar started his career when he formed the Broken Lizard comedy troupe. The original members of the group had known each other since Colgate University, although Jay had been inspired to pursue comedy since high school. He did stand-up comedy performances, and later moved to New York. During this time he was working as a freelance editor and also in the post production team of several films. He would then work on projects featuring the Broken Lizard troupe including the film “Puddle Cruiser” which was funded by their own money. The film would make it to the Sundance Film Festival, then in 2001 they would make another independent film entitled “Super Troopers” – the film was originally intended to be developed at Miramax Films but it did not push through.</p><p>With numerous films under his belt, Jay directed “The Dukes of Hazzard” – based on the 1970s series of the same name – which starred <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> and became a commercial success, despite negative reviews from critics. He then started to direct television episodes, working on series such as “Psych”, “Arrested Development”, “Community”, and “Chuck”, and on “Yogi Bear 2”, “New Girl”, and “Up All Night”.</p><p>A few of his latest directing projects include “The Babymakers” and “Blue Mountain State”. He’s done several acting projects too, including an episode of “Psych” which he also directed, plus appearances in “Jackass: Number Two” and “Community”. His net worth continues to grow.</p><p>Chandrasekhar is known to do stand-up comedy routines often, and tours with Broken Lizard members, usually performing with <a href=#>Kevin Heffernan</a> and <a href=#>Steve Lemme</a>. His stand-up comedy style is usually a mix of stories and jokes, often involving dirty themes.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Jay has been married to actress Susan Clarke since 2005 and they have three children, including twins. Aside from that, Jay’s cousin is <a href=#>Sendhil Ramamurthy</a> who’s best known for being part of “Heroes” as the character Mohinder Suresh. According to Jay, his last name is pronounced “Chan – Drah – Say – Car”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.319884726225><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jay Chandrasekhar</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 9, 1968</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hinsdale, Illinois, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.82 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Film actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Colgate University, Lake Forest Academy</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Susan Clarke</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Jay-Chandrasekhar-92668754533</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/jaychandrasekha</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151540/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series</td></tr><tr readability=19><td>Movies</td><td>Super Troopers, Beerfest, The Dukes of Hazzard, Super Troopers 2, Club Dread, The Babymakers, The Slammin' Salmon, Puddle Cruiser, Freeloaders, Broken Lizard Stands Up, I Love You, Man, The 2 Bobs, Call Me Crazy: A Five Film, Held Up, Yogi Bear 2</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=11.434108527132><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Lives in Mahopac, New York.</td></tr><tr readability=1><td>2</td><td>Cousin of actor <a href=#>Sendhil Ramamurthy</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=5.8258064516129><td>3</td><td>Attended and graduated from Lake Forest Academy, Lake Forest, Illinois.
