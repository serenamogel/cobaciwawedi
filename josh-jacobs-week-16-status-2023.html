His injury is a big concern for Silver and Black’s playoff chances leaving fans desperate for answers.</p><p>But worry not! We will break down the latest news surrounding Josh Jacobs injury, examine rumors, and guess what might happen to Jacobs. Is this a small hiccup or a huge season-ruiner? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Latest Injury Updates on Josh Jacobs</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Josh-Jacobs-Fantasy-Football-Outlook.jpg><p>Josh Jacobs is suffering from a quadriceps injury. He got hurt on December 10, 2023, during the second half of a Week 14 match against the Minnesota Vikings. The Raiders staff and fans were optimistic about a fast recovery and his return by the next match.&nbsp;</p><p>However, with just 90 minutes to go before the Week 15 Thursday Night Football game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Josh was placed on the inactive list.</p><p>Even in the absence of their star running back, the Raiders’ offense held its ground with Zamir White taking on the challenge admirably. Delivering a game-winning performance against the LA Chargers, rushing for 69 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries.</p><p>Zamir’s versatility wasn’t limited to the ground either, he grabbed 4 receptions for 16 yards showcasing his well-rounded skills.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Will Josh Jacobs play in Week 16 against the Chiefs?</strong></h2><p>While Josh Jacobs remains out for now, a glimmer of hope exists for his return this week as he hasn’t been placed on injured reserve. However, fantasy owners shouldn’t jump for joy just yet. To get a full clearance Josh Jacobs has to participate in some practice sessions, throughout the week.</p><p>History whispers optimism: 70% of players with comparable quad injuries miss just one game. But without practice participation, Week 16 for Jacobs is a mystery.</p><p>Given his entire season was played under a one-year contract, with the team clinging to faint playoff aspirations, Jacobs may choose to prioritize free agency over a playoff push.</p><p>This puts fantasy managers in a gamble for Week 16. Monitor his practice reps closely – limited participation could be a telltale sign of benching for bigger future contracts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Josh Jacobs Fantasy Football Outlook</strong></h2><p>There are very slight chances of Josh Jacobs making his appearance at Arrowhead Stadium, in the Week 16 matchup against Kansa City Chiefs. Math whispers “no playoffs” for the Raiders, potentially prompting a strategic move for Jacobs.</p><p>With the playoffs out of reach, the Raiders are unlikely to risk Josh Jacobs’ long-term health. Instead, they may give him an extra week’s rest and target his return for Week 17.</p><p>Given these circumstances, fantasy managers should closely watch Josh Jacobs’ practice sessions and should be ready with options if he is sidelined at the very last moment right before the match.</p><p>The spotlight shines on Zamir White in Jacobs’ absence. He’ll likely shoulder the responsibility of early-down carries, while Ameer Abdullah looks to exploit mismatches in the passing game.</p><p>The Chiefs’ weak run defense (6th-worst DVOA) grants the Raiders a chance to shine with their ground game in Week 16.</p><p>Remember Week 4’s Jacobs masterclass against them? 110 yards, a touchdown, and his second-best fantasy performance ever.&nbsp;</p><p>If the Raiders control the game and exploit the Chiefs’ weakness, they could have another big day running the ball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunC6xaVmo6ejnXqrrcKomaxlp5qyrHmQb2SsrJGpwrR5kWlpbGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maureen-wener-bike-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Maureen Wener Bike Accdent: Hit-and-Run Driver Responsible for School Board Members Deth</span></a>
