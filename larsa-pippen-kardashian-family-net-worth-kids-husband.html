<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Members Of Kardashian Family Followed Larsa Pippen On Instagram</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Larsa Pippen appears to be the real villain in the eyes of the Kardashian family. It has come to acknowledgment that all the members of the Kardashian family have unfollowed their BFF Larsa Pippen on Instagram. You might know Larsa Pippen as a guest who appeared in a couple of episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</span></p><p><span>Larsa Pippen, a 46-year-old reality star, is a friend with the Kardashian family since 2012, especially with Kim, and yet there is no explanation about the ongoing alleged Instagram disputes. Many of the fans believe that it's all because of Kanye West's ranting tweet, who tweeted 'Larsa' with no further explanation on 22 July 2020. The tweet is already deleted, though.</span></p><p><span>But it might not be the prolific reason because the unfollowing dates back to 10 July 2020, which was nearly two weeks before rapper's tweet.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, on the occasion of Larsa's 46th birthday, none of the Kardashian family attended the party. Concerning Larsa's Instagram feed, she has deleted all the pictures with the Kardashian family members except for one with Kourtney Kardashian.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Celebrities/larsa-pippen-kourtney-kardashian.jpg alt width=640 height=640 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Larsa Pippen and Kourtney Kardashian (©: Instagram/Larsa Pippen)</strong></p><p><span>Despite how others think about Larsa and what she actually thinks is a thing that differs here. Concerning the same controversial incident, she tweeted a tweet that appeared to be hectic for her. She wrote while:</span></p><p><span><strong>"</strong><strong>Everybody is focused on who I am following and who I am not on social media. I am focused on my children, my new fitness brand Larsapippenfitness, and my relationships</strong>.<strong>"</strong></span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Celebrities/larsa-pippen-on-twitter.jpg alt width=650 height=407 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span>The unfollowing on social media platforms brought some series of speculations amongst the Kardashian family and their BFF Larsa Pippen. However, legit information is yet to come to the public though it seems real.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Larsa Pippen's Married Life With Scottie Pippen</span></strong></h2><p><span>The 46-year-old reality star was once married to the NBA star Scottie Pippen, and she lived on/off relationship with the athlete.

It came days after the former&nbsp;Real Housewives of Miami&nbsp;star's voice recordings of calling police swirled. She mentioned that her ex-husband was verbally aggressive towards her. At the time, Larsa was said to have dated rapper Future, which was the main reason for the filing of the divorce paper.</span></p><p><span>Another filing came in 2019, where Larsa Pippen filed a divorce case against her ex-husband in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
