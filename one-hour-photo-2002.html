<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>One Hour Photo movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2002)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Sy follows an unvarying routine. There is a diner where he eats, alone, methodically. He is an "ideal employee." He has no friends, a co-worker observes. But the Yorkins serve him as a surrogate family, and he is their self-appointed Uncle Sy. Only occasionally does the world get a glimpse of the volcanic side of his personality, as when he gets into an argument with Larry, the photo machine repairman.</p><p>The Yorkins know him by name, and are a little amused by his devotion. There is an edge of need to his moments with them. If they were to decide to abandon film and get one of those new digital cameras, a prudent instinct might lead them to keep this news from Sy. <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> plays Sy, another of his open-faced, smiling madmen, like the killer in "<a href=#>Insomnia</a>." He does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role. The first time we see Sy behind his counter, neat, smiling, with a few extra pounds from the diner routine, we buy him. He belongs there. He's native to retail.</p><p>The Yorkin family is at first depicted as ideal: models for an ad for their suburban lifestyle. Nina Yorkin (<a href=#>Connie Nielsen</a>), pretty and fresh-scrubbed, has a cheery public persona. Will (<a href=#>Michael Vartan</a>) is your regular clean-cut guy. Young Jake (<a href=#>Dylan Smith</a>) is cute as a picture. <a href=#>Mark Romanek</a>, who wrote and directed the film, is sneaky in the way he so subtly introduces discordant elements into his perfect picture. A tone of voice, a half-glimpsed book cover, a mistaken order, a casual aside ... they don't mean much by themselves, but they add up to an ominous cloud, gathering over the photo counter.</p><p>Much of the film's atmosphere forms through the cinematography, by Jeff Cronenweth. His interiors at "Savmart" are white and bright, almost aggressive. You can hear the fluorescent lights humming. Through choices involving set design and lens choices, the One Hour Photo counter somehow seems an unnatural distance from the other areas of the store, as if the store shuns it, or it has withdrawn into itself. Customers approach it across an exposed expanse of emptiness, with Sy smiling at the end of the trail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46opZ5lmKTCs3nPoaatp11nfXF%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melissa-kinsella-dies-from-cardiac-arrest.html><span>←</span><span>Melissa Kinsella Dies From Cardiac Arrest</span></a>
