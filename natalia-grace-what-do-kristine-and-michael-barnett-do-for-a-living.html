In 2013 they moved to Canada, after which their marriage quickly dissolved. Michael considers himself to be a businessman and has been involved in several jobs and occupations, mostly in retail. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to InTouch</a> he worked district management jobs with companies such as Circuit City and T Mobile. He currently appears to be employed as the director of district operations for a financial company in Indiana.</p><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Kristine grew up Amish, but left the community to marry Michael. Kristine is an author and speaker, advocating for children with autism. She is the founder of the non-profit Jacobs Place, named after her son, who has autism. In addition, she wrote the book The Spark: A Mother’s Story of Nurturing Genius, also about her son. Jacob Barnett, the Barnetts’ biological son, was heralded as a genius, gifted in physics and attended the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo at 15. Kristine’s career has understandably faced challenges due to her 2019 neglect charges and the infamy of the documentary.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>We may never know the Barnett’s true intentions or Natalia’s actual age but we can all agree on one thing. The Curious Case of Natalia Grace is one of the most bizarre true crime stories of our time and the people involved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e82aq5qkmZZ6qL7AnJxmr5iWwW6wzmaiq6GjqbavsYyapZ1lnZ6wqa3EpWSbmaKjsrXAjJ2mZp6fp3qiecuiraKml2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coca-cola-happy-tears-zero-review.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What the New Coca-Cola Happy Tears Tastes Like</span></a>
