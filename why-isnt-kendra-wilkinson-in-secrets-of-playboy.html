She even wrote a book, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny.

But unlike Bridget and Holly, Kendra doesn't have an interview in Secrets of Playboy.</p><p>While she hasn't come out to explain why, it could be because, unlike some of Hugh's other former girlfriends, Kendra would prefer not to talk about her life in the mansion if she can help it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In April 2021, Holly spoke about her time in the Playboy Mansion during an interview with the Call Her Daddy podcast. When E! News shared an Instagram post about Holly's "bombshells" during the interview, Kendra commented (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>), "Dude… it's 2021" with a laughing emoji. She left a follow-up comment that said, "Times have changed.

In her book, Kendra shares that she was never very close with Holly or Bridget.
