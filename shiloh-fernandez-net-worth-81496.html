Fernandez was allegedly Hardwicke's first choice, but it was up to Kristen Stewart who had the last say. <a href=#>Shiloh</a> later recalled on his narrowly missed opportunity, "At the time, it was just another audition. I didn't realize I was missing out on stardom and giant paychecks. Now, looking back on it, I certainly wouldn't have been mentally stable enough to deal with all that. Lucky for me, not getting that part led to other work that was a much better fit for me." Fernandez, who had no formal training, admitted being bashful around other actors during rehearsals. Having done an array of television shows (<i>CSI:NY</i>, <i>The United States of Tara</i>) including starring in the <i>Gossip Girl</i> episode "Valley Girls" as Owen Campos, alongside Brittany Snow and Krysten Ritter. He eventually landed his first big break playing a troubled small-town Texas rink manager in the 2010 Sundance hit <i>Skateland</i> with <i>Twilight</i> alum Ashley Greene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejnbatu8dmnZ6qnpa7pbHZZqWerF2svLPAx2Zvamxpaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-markell-washington-gay-everything-to-know-about-the-tiktok-star.html><span>←</span><span>Is Markell Washington Gay?
