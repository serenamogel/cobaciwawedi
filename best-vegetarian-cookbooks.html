As a three-time cookbook author, I appreciate the time and effort that go into creating a book–the recipe testing, the writing, the photography, and more. I have so much respect for other writers who combine these elements into exciting and accessible vegetarian cookbooks.</p><p>When I write a book, my goal is to offer ideas and inspiration that will make your mealtimes simpler, fresher, and more delicious.

Designed to make it easier for you to eat fresh, flavorful vegetarian meals, it’s filled with recipes that are simple to make with on-hand ingredients (like one-pot soups and sheet pan dinners) and others that are great for making ahead (like sturdy, packable salads and veggie lasagnas).</p><p>But the recipes are just the start! This cookbook also includes eight 3-day meal plans with step-by-step prep instructions and gorgeous charts (like A Guide to Grain Bowls, Mix & Match Veggie Tacos, and more!) that will help you get creative with your cooking.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25.99 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25.99 at Target</a><h2>2.

It also includes handy cooking charts (i.e., how to roast any vegetable, a giant grid of 5-ingredient salad dressings) and resources (like a list of what kitchen tools you actually need) that will make you a more confident and resourceful home cook.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$21.49 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$21.49 at Target</a><h2>3.

Organized by vegetable from A to Z, it’s designed to help you make the most of your farmers market finds. The recipes are super-simple and use minimal ingredients to help you showcase seasonal produce at its best!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$28.49 at Amazon</a><a href=#>$28.49&nbsp;at Target</a><h2>4. Best Elevated Vegetarian: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Plenty by Yotam Ottolenghi</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-vegetarian-cookbooks/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/plenty-3.jpg&description=The+11+Best+Vegetarian+Cookbooks+of+2023")'></span></span></p><p>If you’re a vegetarian, Ottolenghi is a name you need to know. He draws on Middle Eastern influences to craft exciting vegetable recipes that bring restaurant-quality flavors to your home kitchen. This cookbook is entirely vegetarian, but some of the recipes are a bit complex. If you’re looking for quicker and easier options, I recommend starting with another Ottolenghi book, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ottolenghi Simple</a>. It’s not fully vegetarian, but it has tons of fabulous (and, well, simple!) veggie recipes.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17.89 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$19.29 at Target</a><h2>5.

This, her first cookbook, has had a huge influence on my cooking. The recipes all use whole foods ingredients to create flavorful, nourishing meat-free meals. A number of the recipes in the book are fairly involved, but it also features a large section of pantry recipes, which are great foundations for plant-based cooking.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$23.70 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$23.99&nbsp;at Target</a><h2>6.

This cookbook is bursting with easy vegan and vegetarian dishes that you’ll want to add to your rotation. All the recipes are inspired by various Asian cuisines, and they include SO MANY creative ways to use vegetables.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20.99 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$20.99 at Target</a><h2>7.

It may be one of the oldest cookbooks on this list, but Deborah Madison’s tried-and-true recipes never go out of style. It includes more than 1,400 of them–you’ll definitely find a few favorites!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$37.34 at Amazon</a><h2>8.

But if you love veggies, you need it in your collection. It’s a fantastic resource for cooking and eating seasonally. Organized into chapters by season and then by vegetable, it will teach you how to prep, store, and select the best produce at any time of year. The recipes cater to a variety of skill levels, ranging from simple sides to elevated mains, but they all deliver tons of flavor with a few well-chosen ingredients.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24.99 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24.99 at Target</a><h2>9.

A Modern Way to Eat is her first cookbook, and it has a permanent spot on my countertop. Beautifully photographed and designed, it’s packed with inventive vegetarian recipes. It also includes features like graphic flow charts and lists that offer quick, creative ideas for transforming vegetables and other plant-based ingredients into delicious meals.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$35 at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$35.49&nbsp;at Target</a><h2>10.
