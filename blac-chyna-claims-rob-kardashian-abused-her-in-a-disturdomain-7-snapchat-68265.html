At the same time, he's making claims on his own Instagram while bringing their daughter Dream into the mix. Bustle has reached out to representatives of both for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong><a href=# class=T3D>Blac Chyna's lawyer</a> told ABC News in a statement "We are considering all legal options and recourses at this time." Bustle has reached out to Kardashian for comment, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.</p><p><strong>UPDATE #2: </strong><a href=# class=T3D>Kardashian's lawyer</a> told TMZ in a statement that Kardashian's actions were a "spontaneous reaction that he regrets" and that they will not be contesting the restraining order. "Rob's only concern is for the well-being of baby Dream," the statement finished.</p><p><strong>EARLIER: </strong>On Wednesday morning, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kardashian went on an Instagram rampage against Chyna</a>, putting up a series of graphic posts including a video of that appeared to be of Chyna reportedly with another man and since-deleted nude photos of her that he claimed that she sent him. In the posts, Kardashian accuses her of being unfaithful, of heavy drug use, of having Dream out of spite for Tyga, and of using him for money. In one post, he says, “Chyna I hope U find help.” Kardashian also put up screenshots of texts from men he claimed that Chyna was with, asking him for money.</p><p>But Chyna’s Snapchat posts suggest even more, very serious issues between the two, who were engaged in April 2016 and reportedly broke up in February 2017 after an on-again-off-again relationship. While the Snapchats don’t directly address Kardashian’s Instagram posts, they bring a whole new claim to the table, alleging Kardashian put a hand on her and “beat” her:</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Lia Beck/Bustle</p></figure><figure class="Qf5 nbP"><p>Lia Beck/Bustle</p></figure><p>Over the weekend, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Chyna reportedly put up a since-deleted post</a> saying, “Single. I'm happy,” and made a public debut at the BET Awards without Kardashian. The two welcomed their daughter Dream in November 2016, and Kardashian posted about Chyna on Mother’s Day, saying, “happy mama's day to the mother of my only child… I am so Thankful for our beautiful baby girl and so Thankful for YOU and never thought I could be this Happy so thank you for giving me Her.”</p><p>It seems this won’t be the last audiences will hear about the current situation between Chyna and Kardashian. This isn’t just a PR debacle the Kardashian family has to scramble to solve; it seems like help is truly needed here in some way or form, so all involved can move forward in a safe way.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jpujmptdmLW6usBmmqWZmaLAbr7Om2SkmaKZrrS0yJqlZpmSqsCmsIyhnKtlmaN6onnDoqqtraKZvK6tyKeWcGWjo66xr8eaq2ZuaGeDdg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./which-celebrities-lost-their-twitter-verification.html><span>←</span><span>30 Celebrities Who Still Have or Lost Their Twitter Checkmarks</span></a>
