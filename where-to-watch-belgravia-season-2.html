As the show was marketed as a limited series, we didn’t expect more from the Trenchards, but a surprise follow-up arrived at the top of 2024, much to the delight of fans.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>Although it’s convenient to call the show Belgravia season 2, Belgravia: The Next Chapter is its own production with virtually an all-new cast. A more accurate title might be Belgravia: The Next Generation, however, as this series moves the action 30 years deeper into the 19th century, set in 1871, and focuses on a fresh wing of the family. Harriet Slater, Ben Wainwright, and Tony Regbo are among the new faces in the cast. Only Richard Goulding and Alice Eve reprise their roles as Susan and Oliver Trenchard.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>Would it be a grave error if you missed Belgravia?
