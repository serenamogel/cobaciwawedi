That worsened an already career-threatening neck issue. She then became the General Manager of Friday Night Smackdown, among other things.</p><p>The Anti-Diva announced&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that she’ll be parting ways with WWE this month</a>. This is because WWE chose not to re-sign her, As previously reported, Paige penned an emotional letter to<a href=#>&nbsp;WWE on the last day of her contract</a>.</p><p>While speaking on the&nbsp;Reality Of Wrestling&nbsp;podcast, Booker T said that Paige is a unique star who’ll have lots of opportunities outside WWE. Booker T also expects her to be back in WWE within a year.</p><p>“She had a hell of a run as Paige. I thought that gimmick was over. I think being out there right now, she’ll still be able to do her thing and perhaps I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw Paige back in WWE if circumstances work out for her getting back in the ring and proving that she can still do this thing from a safe perspective. I hated it when Paige had to be sidelined because she was different and so unique – and you don’t find that every day in this business. For me, seeing Paige leave WWE will open up more doors for her, and like I said, I’m not going to be surprised if I see her back in the WWE within the next 12 months.”</p><p>Paige is <a href=#>excited to see her journey after WWE</a>. Many believe she might just make her way to AEW, so we’ll have to wait and see if that will happen or not.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
