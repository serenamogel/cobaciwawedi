<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Low Tide movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Alan (<a href=#>Keean Johnson</a>), Red (<a href=#>Alex Neustaedter</a>), and Zmitty (<a href=#>Daniel Zolghadri</a>) live day to day down the Jersey shore. Their backgrounds are left somewhat vague, but one gets the impression that blue-collar, possibly-single parents are a part of the picture. Both to alleviate boredom and so they can get some of the creature comforts life has denied them, the trio performs routine burglaries, nabbing a few things from the McMansions down the shore. In the one that opens the film, Smitty is caught on a second floor when the owners come home, and he’s forced to jump to the patio below, injuring himself pretty badly. This means that the guys will need a new lookout, which brings Alan’s brother Peter (<a href=#>Jaeden Martell</a> of “<a href=#>Midnight Special</a>”) into the gang. Is this the decision that will be their undoing?</p><p>Early on, McMullin sketches character details as a form of foreshadowing. There’s a great scene in which a group of preppie-looking kids pull up to near where the gang is sitting. The rich kids are showing off, playing their music loudly. Red's eyes look red with jealousy and anger. He&nbsp;flashes a knife, just enough so the driver can see it. Not only is Red territorial, but he’s probably a little dangerous. In the same group is a young lady named Mary (<a href=#>Kristine Froseth</a>), who catches Alan’s eye. In one scene, without too much overly expository dialogue, we have easily delineated between Alan and Red – the lover and the fighter. When the boys find some literal treasure as a result of their next job, we can see where the cracks will form before they do.</p><p>“Low Tide” is filled with small decisions that work. It could have been melodramatic nonsense in the wrong hands, but McMullin has a subtle, clever touch—I particularly loved a late scene in which one of the boys is trying to shake down the others and caps his demands with a long sip on a juice box, reminding us these wannabe men are still children. He also works very well with actors, giving all four of his young men a chance to shine while also using <a href=#>Shea Whigham</a> as a local cop. Neustaedter is menacing in just the right measure, Zolghadri looks right on the verge of making a bad decision at all moments, and Johnson has a warm charisma that fits the role. And then there’s Martell, who anchors the film without stealing focus from his supporting actors.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lprBlpJ6xpnnMqK2inV2nsre1xLBka2hhbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./burgundy-waller-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Burgundy Waller Net Worth 2024</span></a>
