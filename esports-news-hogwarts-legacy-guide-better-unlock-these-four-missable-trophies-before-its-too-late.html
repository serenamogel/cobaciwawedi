Faithful fans of Harry Potter and some avid RPG gamers are very hyped for this open-world game. As we discussed before, this game has plenty of missions and quests that <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>can change the outcome of its story for good</a>.</p><p>Games like these are often heavy on hard-to-get trophies too. While some trophies are pretty straightforward for players to earn. Others are missable. If players do not earn these trophies on time, they might have to start the game all over again to earn them.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Here we list the 4 missable trophies in Hogwarts Legacy and ways to unlock them</h2>One thing that needs to be said is that players can only unlock one of these trophies per playthrough. Hence, to unlock all of them, a minimum of 4 playthroughs are mandatory. As they all are associated with one of the four houses in Hogwarts.<img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/hogwarts-3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>The Toast of the Town- Slytherin</strong></p><p><strong>The Auror’s Apprentice- Hufflepuff</strong></p><p><strong>The Gryffindor in the Graveyard- Gyffindor</strong></p><p><strong>The Wise Owl- Ravenclaw</strong></p><p>To unlock these trophies, players must join house one of the four houses during the prologue. And just play through the game normally, and once players get to the quest Jackdaw’s Rest. During this quest, they visit the map chambers of this house. Completing this action would unlock one of these four trophies.</p><p>And then start a new game three more times to unlock three remaining trophies. It is not a very hard thing to do either, this choosing of the houses thing happens around two hours into the game. It is recommended trophy hunters simply skip all the cut scenes to reach this point faster.</p><p>During the house selection ceremony, you are free to choose any of the dialogues and it would not matter, the trophy would still unlock.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>And there are no difficulty trophies!</h2><p>This is one of those games that do not require being played on the highest difficulty to be platinumed. Fans can play it on the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>easiest difficulty and easily earn every trophy</a>.</p><p>The most complicated trophies are those associated with the houses that we mentioned above.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY-&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Which Classes Are Hogwarts Legacy Fans Guaranteed to Experience in the Widely Hyped Game?</a></strong></p><p>So we suggest all the game’s fans go into this game without any worries and you would end up getting platinum in no time!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Ssp6iqpKh6r7HWrGShp5esrrPA0majnp%2BRmMZus9Sim55lkprBtbHRZqynpJ%2BYuG7Ax56qnmWWpMKzecyiqqyZkqGybsDRqKehoZWoeqOxxaipnmWZqcBuwM6oZKWZpJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samuel-moniz.html><span>←</span><span>Samuel Moniz</span></a>
