June was a cherished wife to the late James and a loving mother to David, Anne, Lorna, Carol, and Michelle. She was also a devoted grandmother and great-great-grandmother to many. The funeral service to honor June’s life will take place at Kirkcaldy Crematorium on Tuesday, 19th December, commencing at 10:15 am. All family and friends who knew and loved June are respectfully invited to join us as we bid farewell to a remarkable woman whose presence graced our lives with warmth and love.</p><p>In this time of sorrow, we kindly request family flowers only. For those who wish to offer condolences in a meaningful way, a collection will be held at the end of the service for Cancer Research—a cause close to June’s heart. Your contributions will not only honor her memory but also contribute to the ongoing efforts in the fight against cancer. Following the service, the O’Donnell family warmly invites you to the Beath Inn, Cowdenbeath, to share more memories of June. This gathering will be an opportunity to reflect on the beautiful moments shared, the laughter echoed, and the love that June generously bestowed upon those around her. As we join together, let us find solace in the collective embrace of shared memories and celebrate a life well-lived.</p><p>June’s legacy is not only the love she gave to her family but also the indelible mark she left on the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know her. In the midst of our grief, let us find comfort in the knowledge that June now rests in eternal peace, reunited with her beloved James. To express our gratitude and remembrance for June, we extend our heartfelt thanks to all who have reached out with condolences, support, and shared memories. Your presence, whether in person or in spirit, contributes to the tapestry of love and unity that defines the memory of June O’Donnell.</p><p>As we prepare to bid farewell to June, let us remember the joy she brought into our lives, the lessons she imparted, and the love that will forever echo in the hearts of her family and friends. May the funeral service be a poignant reflection of the beautiful life she lived, and may the gathering afterward be a testament to the enduring bonds of friendship and family she cultivated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwucCrnpqqlal6rq%2FBq6CdnV2kr6rA1JqpsmWRYrmqssRmrp6knGK5qsLEnWSipl2hvLexjJqlnWWWlra1tI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-la-duena-del-swing-by-los-hermanos-rosario.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: La Duea del Swing by Los Hermanos Rosario</span></a>
