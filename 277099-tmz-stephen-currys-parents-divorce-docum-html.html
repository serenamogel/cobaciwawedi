Sonya also made a name for herself as an athlete. She played volleyball and was a serious, determined, self-motivated team leader.</p><p class=dh>When Sonya Curry was in the eighth grade at Tadford High School, she was promoted to the varsity volleyball team courtesy of the local high school's volleyball coach, John Pierce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/3bd2196fc1b89e62a53588a50263093e7f0fe7c316347726181f63b34f7be081.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Stephen Curry and his parents Dell Curry and his mother Sonya Curry at Warriors headquarters in Oakland, California on June 26, 2009. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>By the time she reached her senior year, her school had secured the state AA championship, and she had earned recognition as Virginia's defensive player of the year. Sonya not only played volleyball; she also made her mark in basketball, excelling as a defensive specialist and leading the Radford girls to two state titles.</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, Sonya Curry showcased her skills on the state stage in track and field by competing in events such as the 400-meter hurdles and sprint relays. As she approached the end of her high school journey, Sonya received numerous college offers, with some institutions expressing interest in her talents for both volleyball and basketball.</p><p class=dh>Despite being a talented athlete, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/ostler/article/How-Splash-Mothers-begat-the-Warriors-12460274.php>Steph's mother </a>never pushed her children into sports. But when her children showed their passion and interest, she fully supported them. Sonya drove her children to practices, taught them self-discipline, and instilled good values.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d8566bae91fc493545c1f06bced620504f1db92d11a44dbe9b94bfc58a2f8042.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Dell Curry and Sonya Curry attend game one of the NBA Western Conference Finals at ORACLE Arena on May 14, 2019. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Did Steph Curry's Parents Meet?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Sonya met Dell Curry when she was still contemplating which college to join. It was during this time that she got involved in an accident, and her car was wrecked. She said the accident was a sign for her not to attend James Madison University.</p><p class=dh>Instead, she decided to remain closer to her home and ultimately selected Virginia Tech as her college destination. During her official recruiting visit to the university, she first crossed paths with Dell Curry. While observing a Men's Basketball practice, Sonya noticed Dell and the feeling was mutual—it was love at first sight.</p><p class=dh>They tied the knot in 1988 and were blessed with three children: Steph, Seth, and Sydel. While Steph and Seth have achieved significant success as athletes, Sydel pursued a different career path. However, she, too, made a mark for herself by participating in college volleyball.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Steph Curry's</a> parents were often at their children's games, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/05/warriors-trail-blazers-steph-curry-seth-curry-parents-rooting>rooting for their sons</a> Steph and Seth's teams. In 2019, it was an entirely new experience for them to watch their sons play against each other for the first time. Steph, who plays for the Golden State Warriors, hosted Seth, who was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers.</p><p class=dh>In an interview, Steph Curry's parents shared their approach of how they decided <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/sports/curry-sonya-dell-steph-seth.html>which son</a> they would cheer for in each game. According to Steph's mother, Sonya, they had agreed to flip a coin, and the coin toss outcome would determine which jersey each parent would wear and which son they would support during the game.</p><p class=dh>Sonya described the experience as enjoyable and a true blessing. She expressed her excitement about watching her sons play, with a particular anticipation for watching Seth in action. She emphasized she was eager to see <a class="me a" href=#>Seth Curry</a> excel by stealing the ball and shooting over Steph.</p><p class=dh>Steph also shared the experience, calling it a win-win situation for their parents. Sonya also stated that even though one of her sons' teams would go home, she was excited that the other team was going for the championship.</p><p class=dh>In 2021, Stephy Curry's parents decided to go their separate ways after 33 years of marriage. Sonya Curry <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/23/sonya-dell-curry-divorce-steph-golden-state-warriors/>initiated the divorce,</a> accusing Dell of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/24/steph-currys-parents-sonya-and-dell-accuse-each-other-of-cheating-in-divorce-docs/>cheating on her</a> with different women when they were still married. She also alleged that Dell's affair was known to family and friends.</p><p class=dh>On the other hand, Dell alleged in the divorce documents that Sonya was the unfaithful one. He accused Sonya of marital misconduct and lying about it. Dell also claimed at the time that Sonya had already moved in with another man and suggested that she was no longer eligible to receive alimony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtucGhpbnq1udlmqq2doJ2yr3nCrqmrsaNivaK%2BxKerrGWUnsOwvsKeZJ2nk6q6b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richard-dawson-biography-age-net-worth-cause-of-death-wife-children-height-family-feud-boxer-funeral-wikipedia-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Richard Dawson Biography: Age, Net Worth, Cause Of Death, Wife, Children, Height, Family Feud, Boxer</span></a>
