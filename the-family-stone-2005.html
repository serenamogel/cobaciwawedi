<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Family Stone movie review (2005)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>So let's see what it is. As the movie opens, the Stones are preparing to celebrate Christmas. The oldest son, Everett (Dermot Mulroney) is bringing home his fiancee Meredith (<a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>) to meet the family. Meredith is not going to be an easy fit. She's aggressive, uptight, hyper-sensitive and dresses like someone who has never been undressed.</p><p>Waiting in the hometown are Everett's family: His mom Sybil (Diane Keaton), his dad Kelly (<a href=#>Craig T. Nelson</a>), his brother Ben (Luke Wilson), his gay and deaf brother Thad (Ty Giordano), and his kid sister Amy (<a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a>). We will also meet Thad's African-American partner, Patrick (Brian White), and their adopted son.</p><p>So, OK, if the Stones are OK with Patrick, they're strong on empathy and acceptance. Therefore, if they don't like Meredith, it is because she is not to be liked. And that does seem to be the case, because (1) it is instantly obvious to her mother Sybil that this is the wrong woman for her son Everett, and (2) poor Meredith is one of those perfectionists who in their rigid compulsion to do the right thing always succeed in doing the wrong one.</p><p>Sir Michael Tippett, who wrote operas, said, "There is only one comic plot: the unexpected hindrances to an eventual marriage." While this definition does not encompass "A Night at the Opera" or "<a href=#>Babe: Pig in the City</a>," there is much truth in it. In Meredith's case, she is her own greatest hindrance to marriage, and the more she realizes that, the deeper the hole she digs.</p><p>The screenplay by director <a href=#>Thomas Bezucha</a> establishes subplots around this central fact. We learn that Everett is drawn to Meredith partly because he believes that to be successful in business, he should be more like her and less like he really is. We learn that Ben, the Luke Wilson character, thinks of himself as a wild and crazy guy. We meet Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes), who flies in to rescue her sister and turns into a second fly in the same ointment. Julie is as relaxed and natural as Meredith is emotionally constipated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55llpa6qrjYZqqtp56aenN8j24%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stefania-lavie-owen-net-worth-81118.html><span>←</span><span>Stefania LaVie Owen Net Worth</span></a>
