The movie's opening scenes show the three Libner brothers in the 1950s, at earlier ages. Already they're fighting all the time: Marvin (Daniel Stern), the oldest, a would-be disciplinarian; Buddy (Ayre Gross), in the middle, the dreamer and clown, and Bobby (Patrick Dempsey), the youngest, the rebel. Then we flash forward to 1963.
Marvin has just been discharged from the Air Force and has returned home to pick up a 1954 Coupe de Ville and deliver it to Florida.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Horny horror fans name the films which are as titillating as they are terrifying</h2><time>Apr 28, 2024</time>

Horror feasts on some of the most fascinating fears ad blemishes of the human psyche, as well as focussing on unconscious desires. Among favorites in the genre is erotic horror, because getting bloody is quite the aphrodisiac, apparently.

Mills is a hell of a writer. That was evident in his second feature, "Beginners," where Christopher Plummer gave an Oscar-winning performance as a father who came out of the closet at age 75. "Beginners" was about Mills' father; "20th Century Women" is about his mother. Together the films form bookend narratives of love, tribute and elegy. John Steinbeck wrote East of Eden, in part, for his two sons, to show them what his childhood had been like, what Salinas Valley was like back in the day, what their ancestors were like.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>BBNaija Reunion 2021: Erica Is A Classy Babe Actress Stella Damasus Goes Crazy Over Erica</h2><time>Apr 27, 2024</time>
