<a href=../../../../fitzcarraldo-1982.html></a>
Herzog finally settled on the right actor to play Fitzcarraldo, author of this plan: Klaus Kinski, the shock-haired German who starred in Herzog's "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" and "Nosferatu," is back again to mastermind the effort. Kinski is perfectly cast. Herzog's original choice for the role was Jason Robards, who is also gifted at conveying a consuming passion, but Kinski, wild-eyed and ferocious, consumes the screen. There are other characters important to the story, especially Claudia Cardinale as the madam who loves Fitzcarraldo and helps finance his attempt, but without Kinski at the core it's doubtful this story would work.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>BTS's V (Kim Taehyung) Hits Milestone of 800 Million Spotify Streams with Just 3 OSTs!!</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>
