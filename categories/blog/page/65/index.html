Answer
Starting fluid is sprayed into the engine intake near the air filter, or into the carburetor bore or a spark plug hole of an engine in order to get additional fuel into the combustion cylinder as quickly as possible. It is used more frequently with carbureted engines than with fuel injection systems.
Similarly, one might wonder if one can spray carb cleaner into the spark plug hole?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Im Yoona Net Worth</h2><time>Feb 27, 2024</time>

Reading the paper, September 7, 2007 (By Elizabeth Perry; click)
This morning, I went to Huffington Post and realized it had become too slow for me. Perhaps as a strategy to generate more clicks and longer visit times, they make it tricky to get to the god-damned stories themselves.
