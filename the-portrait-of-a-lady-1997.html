<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Portrait Of A Lady movie review (1997)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Why does she turn down Warburton? Because he is too right, too safe and sure, and she seeks a spark of inspiration in her man. One of those astounded by her decision is her cousin Ralph (<a href=#>Martin Donovan</a>), who also loves Isabel, but keeps that a secret because he is dying of consumption. "I shall have the pleasure,'' he muses, "of seeing what a young lady does who rejects Lord Warburton.'' It will be no pleasure.</p><p>Ralph lives with his parents, the rich Touchetts (<a href=#>John Gielgud</a> and <a href=#>Shelley Winters</a>). Knowing Isabel has rejected Warburton, aware of her poverty, he fears her spirit will be crushed by the hard realities of Europe. He wants her to have a chance to bloom. As his father lays dying, Ralph asks him to leave a large portion of his inheritance to the young woman. Ralph explains, "I call people rich when they are able to meet the requirements of their imagination.'' Isabel, surprised by the bequest and never suspecting its reason, embarks on the grand tour. In Rome she swims into the net of Madame Merle (<a href=#>Barbara Hershey</a>), an independent woman who knows everyone and is frank about her purpose: "I don't pretend to know what people are meant for. I only know what I can do with them.'' Merle, knowing what she can do with Isabel, delivers her to the indolent expatriate artist Gilbert Osmond (<a href=#>John Malkovich</a>). Osmond is a fake--a lazy fraud with more manner than means. But Isabel, who could see Lord Warburton's flaws, cannot see Gilbert's, and soon she is married. He has a daughter named Pansy; he explains vaguely that his first wife is deceased. Isabel comes to love Pansy, and soon she loves her a great deal more than Osmond.</p><p>The story leaps forward three years, to a time when Isabel and Gilbert coexist in a hateful truce. Her cousin Ralph, visiting Rome, sees through their marriage: "Weren't you meant for something better than to keep guard over the sensibilities of a sterile dilettante?'' Then the noose tightens, as Isabel discovers the exact nature of her situation.</p><p>I will not reveal more. Yet I assume that most of the people going to see this movie will have read the book, and, frankly, you can't easily understand this film if you haven't. Too much is left out, glossed over, or implied.</p><p>Why, for example, does Isabel marry Osmond? In the novel there is no mystery. He is an Artist--able to pose, at least during their courtship, as a man who lives on a higher plane. In Campion's film, Osmond is never allowed the slightest plausibility. Malkovich plays him as a snaky, sinister poseur, tobacco smoke coiling past his hooded eyes. The crucial distinction is: In the novel, Isabel marries him because she is an idealist, but in the movie because she is a masochist.</p><p>This difference is fatal to the development of the story. To Ralph, she must seem more stupid than brave. Madame Merle's manipulation becomes cynical, not simply opportunistic. Even Osmond seems more a villain here (where he is not deceived by his intentions) than in the novel (where he half-believes his lies).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55loKS%2Ftb7Aoqtmp5Zirm64wJ2wZmlpboQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christopher-winchester.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Winchester Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
