Dorit’s husband Paul Kemsley is a successful real estate developer and celebrity manager. Paul currently manages soccer legend Pele and singer Boy George through a management company called Nixxi Entertainment. Boy George periodically lives with the Kemsleys and is godfather to Paul and Dorit’s son.</p><p>Dorit came to the world of reality TV through Real Housewife Lisa Vanderpump. Dorit is Lisa’s personal designer and she will join the cast at the start of the 7th season of RHOB which premiered on December 6, 2016. Dorit also operates a fashion/swimwear company called Dorit. Her company produces clothes, swimwear, resort-wear and more that have an Italian inspiration. She and Paul married in 2015 at the Rainbow Room in New York. She and Paul have two children, Jagger and Phoenix. They live in a large Beverly Hills mansion which at one point was on the market for $12 million. When she isn’t designing, managing or appearing on TV, Dorit Kemsley is an active philanthropist who supports a number of children’s charities. In August 2018 it was revealed that Paul Kemsley wracked up $3.6 million worth of gambling debt at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. According to the court filing, Paul made five payments to the Bellagio between 2010 and 2011 totaling $850,000. The couple filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and hoped to have their Vegas debts cleared. In the meantime, Dorit herself has been sued by a former partner in her bathing suit company claiming he fronted the couple more than $200,000 to launch the business. The Kemsleys deny this claim.</p><p><strong>Dorit and Paul Kemsley Real Estate</strong>: In August 2019 Paul and Dorit spent $6.5 million to acquire a home in the Encino area of Los Angeles. In September 2020 they put this home on the market for $9.5 million. The home listing was handled by Mauricio Umansky who is the husband of Dorit’s Real Housewives cast mate Kyle richards.</p><p>On the RHOB they are seen living in a large Beverly Hills mansion that the Kemsleys actually co-own with a business partner. This mansion was listed at one point for $12.85 million, and was eventually reduced to $7.5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfp7a1ecqepKykla7AbrrErWSwp6KptW6uyKieq5mgncZussCcq2abkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-tsa-confiscate-knitting-needles.html><span>←</span><span>Does TSA confiscate knitting needles?</span></a>
