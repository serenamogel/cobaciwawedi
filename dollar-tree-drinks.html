We’re updating this page with the best Dollar Tree drinks we see on our frequent Dollar Tree walks. Check out what the D-Tree had to offer on our most recent visit.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Dollar Tree comes in handy for many shopping needs: <a href=#>canned foods</a>, <a href=#>frozen foods</a>, <a href=#>healthy snacks</a>, and, of course, budget-friendly beverages. In fact, during our last trip there, we explored the beverage aisle with a sense of childlike wonder. So here’s a guide to the best kinds of Dollar Tree drinks we found, from us to you.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: not everything you see in-store at Dollar Tree will show up online. (In fact, a lot of it won’t! Isn’t that fun?) You’re going in blind, folks. But that’s what makes every trip to Dollar Tree an adventure! Make peace with the chaos, and you’ll be just fine.&nbsp;</p><strong><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sprecherbrewery.com/products/strawberry-charged-lemonade-cans-12-pack rel=noopener>Sprecher Charged Strawberry Lemonade</a></strong><p>I saw this Sprecher lemonade at my local Dollar Tree and figured it looked novel enough to include on this. Honestly, it just makes sense that you can find a caffeinated sparkling strawberry lemonade of all things at Dollar Tree. What doesn’t make sense? Someone selling a pair of cans for more than <a href=# rel=noopener>three times the sticker price</a> on eBay. Is this a rare product? Does it have some kind of cult following among monied lemonade fans who are willing to pay big bucks for the hookup? I guess I should have bought out the store and paid my rent for the rest of the year. Go to your nearest Dollar Tree and get ready to flip some product if they have these!</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-lemonade/>best lemonade</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sonic Cherry Limeade Zero Sugar Drink Mix</strong></a><p>Now, this is a Dollar Tree drink that actually does have a cult following. <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.mashed.com/666200/the-massive-amount-of-cherry-limeade-sonic-sells-every-year/#:~:text=Sweet%20and%20tangy%2C%20Sonic's%20cherry,lot%20of%20freshly%20squeezed%20limes." rel=noopener>Sonic reportedly sells</a> enough Cherry Limeade each year to fill 15 Olympic-size swimming pools. If you find yourself craving a refreshing glass of the stuff but don’t have a Sonic nearby (or an Olympic-size swimming pool full of limeade nearby), check your local Dollar Tree for these drink mix packets as a substitute. Unlike Sonic’s in-store version, these drink packets are totally sugar free, which makes them easier to justify guzzling on the daily.</p><p><strong>Read our full ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-water-flavoring/>best water flavorings</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brisk Half & Half Iced Tea & Watermelon Lemonade</strong></a><p>“<a href=# rel=noopener>Do you think god stays in heaven because he too lives in fear of what he’s created?</a>” I imagine whoever created the page for the Brisk Half & Half Iced Tea & Watermelon Lemonade on Dollar Tree’s site feels this way. The vibes of this Dollar Tree drink were so intense, they couldn’t even put a front-facing picture out there for the public to view. Frankly, this is precisely the sort of unhinged Franken-beverage we want when we’re looking for the best Dollar Tree drinks.</p><strong><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Celsius <strong><strong></strong></strong></a><strong><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Sparkling Orange</a></strong></strong> Energy Drink</strong></strong><p>There are a lot of energy drinks to choose from at Dollar Tree, so why would you choose one that’s twice as expensive as the others? Well for one thing, Celsius Sparkling Orange comes backed by Sporked’s best <a href=#>taste testers</a>, so obviously it should be an easy grab. Also, it doesn’t actually cost that much. I just wanted to be dramatic, but it was $2.50 at my store versus the $1.25 base price of most Dollar Tree products. It’s worth the “splurge” because you know it’s good—citrusy, lightly bubbly, and super refreshing. If the other best Dollar Tree drinks on this list are too nuts for you, this is a good pick.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-energy-drink/>best energy drinks</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Señorial Sangria Soda</strong></a><p>It’s time for the requisite “fun but not so fun that you don’t actually want to drink it” drink at Dollar tree. A Sangria-flavored soda is the perfect thing to grab as summer approaches. Sometimes drinking all day while you’re out at the pool sounds fun in theory, but you may not want to deal with a hangover the next day. This is an easy way to get into the mood without fully committing to the hassle that comes with day drinking. And hey, if you do want to go all out, you could easily use this as a mixer for a quick and simple cocktail.</p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>International Delight Oreo Iced Coffee</a></strong><p>Yeah, I’m an <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-oreo-flavors/>Oreo</a> guy, so of course I’m going to recommend the Oreo iced coffee that I saw at Dollar Tree. The only other fun coffee I found was a Twinkies flavored iced latte, so maybe you should hear me out on this one. Even if it doesn’t totally kill your craving for some cookies, this is a fun thing to grab on your way out the door in the morning.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-canned-lattes/>best canned lattes</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>SunnyD Orange-Flavored Citrus Punch</a></strong><p>I won’t even pretend to understand how a 56 ounce bottle of SunnyD can be sold for $1.25 at Dollar Tree. I can, however, vouch for how good SunnyD is and why this stuff is a must the next time you swing by your local D-Tree. Keep this in the fridge when you need something to go with your waffles in the morning or for your kids to drink when they get home from school. It’s nostalgic, sweet, and refreshing. It’s the perfect thing to have in the fridge for summer break—even if you’re an adult and summer break is a thing of the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJyfobmivoytqZ6dXZm%2FqrrKrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taehyung-reach-800-million-streams-on-spotify.html><span>←</span><span>BTS's V (Kim Taehyung) Hits Milestone of 800 Million Spotify Streams with Just 3 OSTs!!</span></a>
