Every once in a while, a group emerges that completely shatters and staggers us off our feet. In 2011, it was EXO; two years later, BTS; then came GOT7. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the fourth-generation leaders</a> are undeniably <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stray Kids</a></strong>. They’re filling up stadiums and transforming the K-Pop sound in ways that rival BTS’ own full force. Internationally, they’ve also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">been making their mark in the music world well known</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>At this point in time, anyone even remotely acquainted with K-pop should feel an ounce of shame <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for not knowing Stray Kids</a>. However, what they may not know is that Stray Kids <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was originally a nine-piece group</a>. Unfortunately, Woojin left the group a couple of years later, leaving fans wondering what had happened. Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">K-pop fans are not unfamiliar with members leaving their favorite groups</a>, no one initially saw this coming — especially as Woojin was already so well integrated into the music world.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-woojin-split-from-stray-kids data-injectable=false>Why did Woojin split from Stray Kids?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Woojin left JYP Entertainment, and consequently, Stray Kids, in 2019 — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two years after the group’s debut</a>. Contrary to what many believed and speculated at the time, Woojin allegedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never had any bad blood </a>with any of his former colleagues. Instead, his separation from the group stemmed from his desire to pursue a solo career. So much so, that in 2019, he signed with 10x Entertainment in hopes of finally launching his solo activities.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>A year later, upon leaving the group, many so-called fans believed they had found the real reason for Woojin’s departure. An anonymous Twitter user accused Woojin of sexual misconduct — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a crime that is often swept under the rug among idols</a>. Since then, the user — who was then discovered to have been Brazilian and not of Korean nationality as they claimed — was accused of defamation, with more than enough evidence to declare Woojin a victim of an anti-fan’s attempt to ruin his image.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Woojin from Stray Kids now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 김우진 KIM WOOJIN (@woooojin0408)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Ultimately, there is no bad reason behind Woojin’s departure from the group. However, since then, the 26-year-old singer and actor has only released one debut mini-album, “The Moment: A Minor,” in 2021. Despite not releasing any more solo music, Woojin’s name can be seen featured in several original soundtracks, including the highly acclaimed 2021 K-drama Reborn Rich.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=false>Just in 2023, if you were attentive enough, you might have been lucky to catch Woojin in the theatrical production of Sherlock Holmes: The Secret of the Andersons. Albeit it only lasted a couple of nights in September, it is highly unusual for a K-Pop idol to debut himself on the theatre stage, but it happened for a selected lucky few. Here’s to hoping there’s more music for Woojin in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn56mXZm2pXnWqKajoZ5iuaat1Z5krKyilsZut8idqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-harris-1925-2013-a-remembrance.html><span>←</span><span>Julie Harris, 1925-2013: A Remembrance | Features</span></a>
