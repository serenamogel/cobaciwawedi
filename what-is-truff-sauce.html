So, what’s one more to throw in your orbit? Let’s talk Truff sauce!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-truff-sauce><strong>What is Truff sauce?</strong></h2><p>The original Truff sauce is simply truffle infused hot sauce. It’s a mix of red chili peppers, black truffle, agave nectar, and spices. But Truff has expanded their line-up to include way more than just the original. Now, there’s Truff White (made with white truffles instead of black truffles as well as some coriander), Truff Hotter (a spicier version of the original flavor, which began as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taco Bell Truff sauce partnership</a>), and Truff White Hotter (a hotter version of Truff White), along with a line of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mayos, oils, pasta sauces, and salts</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-truff-sauce-good><strong>Is Truff sauce good?</strong></h2><p>Well, much like beauty being in the eye of the beholder, whether one enjoys the taste of Truff sauce is entirely dependent on one’s own tastes. According to reviews, most connoisseurs are giving it a positive rating, and saying it lives up to the hype that social media has been giving it as of late. And it’s one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best hot sauces</a> according to Sporked’s taste test. I suppose it all breaks down to whether one enjoys the taste of black truffles paired with a spicy kick in the pants. If that sounds up your alley, and you’ve got about 17 bucks, then you’re in business…Truff it up!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-truff-sauce-taste-like><strong>What does Truff sauce taste like?</strong></h2><p>It initially kicks in with a sweet taste, due to the agave in the recipe. After that fades, the chili peppers begin to take over. Once that heat starts dissipating, you taste the black truffle flavor you ostensibly came for. Unless you just bought the bottle for the artwork? It is very nice packaging.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-truff-sauce-spicy><strong>Is Truff sauce spicy?</strong></h2><p>It better be! That’s why we eat the stuff, right?According to the TRUFF website, their sauce is somewhere between 2,500-3,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). For reference, that’s about as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spicy as Tapatio</a>. So, while you won’t be breathing fire while steam shoots out your ears after dousing a burrito with it, Truff can certainly hold its own in the spice department.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-truff-sauce-vegan><strong>Is Truff sauce vegan?</strong></h2><p>All varieties of Truff hot sauces are 100% vegan. It always brings a smile to my face to think about a food that can be enjoyed by folks across the board! A tear to my eye, too, but that may just be from the spiciness.</p><p>Truff sauce may not be the spiciest condiment in the aisle, but it’s the only one bringing that specific truffle flavor to the hot sauce arena. Give it a go the next time you’re in the mood to douse your tacos with something a little more adventurous than Taco Bell Mild!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmq6utlpt6tK3UnJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anchorman-legend-continues-official-release-date.html><span>←</span><span>This Just In!
