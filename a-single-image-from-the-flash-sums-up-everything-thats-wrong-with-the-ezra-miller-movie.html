Sure, ensemble adventures like Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers are highlights, but if you’re a fan of Spider-Man and you go to watch the latest flick about Peter Parker but it ends up basically being about Dr. Strange, you’re entitled to feel a little bit upset. And, as it appears from a still from <strong>The Flash</strong>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC hasn’t really figured this out</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This image alone says everything you need to know about the movie <a href=#>https://t.co/JWWmtWaXTv</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/C5jTdFL84G</a></p>— 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝗺𝗼 🪐 (@SupermanShiII) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=911 data-injectable=true>The newest film about Barry Allen is heavily based on the Flashpoint series of comic books, which involve Allen accidentally traveling into an alternate reality where Batman is an unhinged Thomas Wayne, driven to vigilante justice after his son Bruce was murdered (and Martha Wayne, Bruce’s mother, is the Joker), Superman has become Supergirl, and there are plenty of other wild mixups. While the comic is intriguing, it appears the film seems to have taken the worst liberties it could with the source material, angering fans who don’t want another Batman vs Superman, but seem destined to get it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>here we go again, another DC movie where Batman (or superman) has to carry, are there actually any DC movies that dont cameo/reference these two? 💀</p>— Harry (@Harry_jcw) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=true>While it makes some degree of sense from a commercial perspective for DC to hinge this film on Batman and someone from Krypton (albeit Supergirl, not Man), then maybe it should have been called something else. And, perhaps, the titular character shouldn’t be repurposing an old batsuit for their costume.</p><p data-characters=627 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>With that said, new head of the DCU studio James Gunn has said that The Flash is one of the films that will reset the comic book universe for his new slate of films and shows, subtitled Gods and Monsters. So, given that this is going to be one of the last films in the current DC stable, there is a bit more leeway for creative decisions that aren’t so in keeping with canon – and some fans have argued that complaining about this kind of petty stuff is exactly why people hate many fandoms, especially when there is a fairly logical and simple explanation as to why The Flash might be wearing a repurposed batsuit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Its not that big of a deal. Bro had no suit so Bats let him borrow and modify an old one so he could fight. There is literally nothing wrong with this. Y’all be killing me I swear LMFAO</p>— Austin Bitikofer (@BitikoferAustin) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>With all that said, if there really was a reason to boycott the new Flash film, it’s the recent troubling behavior of its star Ezra Miller. They’ve been accused of everything from grooming to straight-up burglary, which isn’t the best look for a star.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>honestly, this image is all I need to know about the movie <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/C0rEv0P6SI</a></p>— Charlie DeMott Wildey (@charliewildey) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=false>Miller’s future in the DCU remains up for debate, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gunn unwilling to take a firm stance on it yet</a>. However, if this does end up as the actor’s last film, then they’ve at least left with a bang, even if it’s one fans don’t appreciate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGarmaO0rbGMoqSan5Vis7O7zGaroZ1dm7miv8dmqq6lo2LCsXnEr5yrsaSdtq%2BzjK2fmqyjYsSzu82gZLChpJ16tbTEZpyzqpFiuqq4y56pZqWfq7amew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-last-mercenary-movie-review-2021.html><span>←</span><span>The Last Mercenary movie review (2021)</span></a>
