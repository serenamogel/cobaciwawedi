Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
They tell you while you‚Äôre young
‚ÄúGirls, go out and have your fun‚Äù

Hopper leaves. Rossellini discovers MacLachlan in the closet and, to his astonishment, pulls a knife on him and forces him to submit to her seduction. He is appalled but fascinated; she wants him to be a "bad boy" and hit her.
