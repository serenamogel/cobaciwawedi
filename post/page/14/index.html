There are also a few rare tender moments where Van Damme lets his emotional guard down long enough to joke about how uncomfortable he is playing against type. Van Damme never really tries to escape his former self, but it is kind of endearing to see him, as embarrassed papa Richard, try to be a better person. In “The Last Mercenary,” Richard only returns to France after he learns that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has mistaken Archibald—who, thanks to his dad’s skillful negotiation, was living under an assumed name, and with diplomatic immunity—for Simyon, a callow arms dealer from the fictional country of Taarghistan.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A single image from The Flash sums up everything thats wrong with the Ezra Miller movie</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

She knows what the arrival of Israeli soldiers at her door means—her son Jonathan has died in the line of duty. The arriving soldiers confirm this news to Dafna’s husband Michael (the excellent Lior Ashkenazi), and Maoz’s formalism is instantly clear and striking. He opens his film with procedure. It’s not just the information of the death of a child but the procedure that entails.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Valentine's Day Homemade Gumdrops Recipe</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>
