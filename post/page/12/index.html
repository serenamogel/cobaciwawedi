Barbara Harris discovers to her horror that she is the occupant of her daughter's body, is gulping down a rum-flavored pineapple ice cream whip in the local malt shop and is expected to play field hockey later in the day. Jodie Foster discovers to her intense dismay that she occupies her mother's body and is not, therefore, expected to leave the house on a skateboard.
The day's adventures revolve around their difficulties, and also around the Disney organization's recent fascination with people in bodies not their own.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Inkwell movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1994)</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

There is a difference, though. All of the characters in the movie are African-Americans. And the "Inkwell" is the name of a beach on Martha's Vineyard where the black bourgeoisie have owned summer homes for decades.

"The Member of the Wedding" is Harris's signature part, and the film of it would be enough to secure her place in the pantheon of American actors, but she will always be best known as Abra, the girl that James Dean loves in "East of Eden" (1955). That is Dean's movie, but Harris is right there with him, helping him, listening to him, feeling a kinship to him as one emotional freak to another.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>When did Woojin leave Stray Kids?</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>
