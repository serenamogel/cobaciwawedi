That was evident in his second feature, "Beginners," where Christopher Plummer gave an Oscar-winning performance as a father who came out of the closet at age 75. "Beginners" was about Mills' father; "20th Century Women" is about his mother. Together the films form bookend narratives of love, tribute and elegy.

Or perhaps you bought two monitors, and have a post-it with crosshairs in the middle? Apparently ASUS has a solution for you – at least for specific monitors.
Introducing ASUS’ Bezel Free kit: the design is overtly simple – by using a flexible plastic bi-prism where two monitors meet, the screen will be distorted enough that a gamer brain will not be able to see the bezel.</description></item><item><title>Simon Cowell recovering from operation after breaking back in e-bike crash</title><link>/simon-cowell-recovering-from-operation-after-breaking-back-in-e-bike-crash.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/simon-cowell-recovering-from-operation-after-breaking-back-in-e-bike-crash.html</guid><description>Simon Cowell has had surgery after breaking his back.

Stepping down to their value line keeps the same powerful internals, but to hit this price point ASUS has taken some liberties with the chassis design.

The top has a brushed finish with lines running parallel down the entire device, which looks nice, but that’s where the premium materials end.</description></item><item><title>Corbin Bernsen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</title><link>/corbin-bernsen.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/corbin-bernsen.html</guid><description>Ebert Club #75 August 10, 2011 Marie Haws &amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp; 2011-08-07 Marie writes: I attended three different elementary schools; St. Peter's, Our Lady of Mercy (which was anything but) and finally St. Micheal's; where I met my Canadian-Italian chum, Marta Chiavacci (key-a-vah-chee) who was born here to Italian immigrants.

It shows unformed young men starting from similar places, but taking different roads because of their characters. Garcia Lorca, who is honest with himself about his love for another man, finds real love eventually with a woman, his classmate Margarita (Marina Gatell).</description></item><item><title>What is bye called in South Korea?</title><link>/what-is-bye-called-in-south-korea.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-is-bye-called-in-south-korea.html</guid><description>“Goodbye” in Korean (standard) There are 4 ways to say “Goodbye” in Korean that use the Standard form: You can say 안녕히 가세요 (annyeonghi gaseyo), 안녕히 계세요 (annyeonghi gyeseyo), 가세요 (gaseyo), and 잘 가요 (jal gayo).
