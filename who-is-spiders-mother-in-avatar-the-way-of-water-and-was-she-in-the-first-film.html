Recommended Videos Avatar: The Way of Water introduced a stack of new characters in the Avatar film franchise, and one of them is a human teenager named Spider. Born on Pandora, Spider was unable to return to Earth after the first Pandora mission because he was too young to be sent back in cryotherapy.
Now we know who Spider’s father is — Colonel Miles Quaritch, the big bad guy from the original film."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While Spider found a place in Jake Sully’s family, he was reunited with his father in his Avatar form. He tried to bond with his son, but the way he treated the Na’vi and the rest of Pandora’s wildlife caused Spider to leave his side by the end of the film.</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=119 data-injectable=false>One thing the film doesn’t address, however, is his mother. Who gave birth to him? And where was she in the film?</p><h2 id=h-did-we-meet-spider-s-mother data-injectable=false>Did we meet Spider’s mother?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Fortunately for those who want to know more information about the world of Avatar and Pandora, Cameron released a series of graphic novels that detail other characters and events outside of the main films — one of those events is the birth of Spider. Spider was born in the year 2154 in Hell’s Gate, the first human colony in Pandora. His character was first introduced in&nbsp;Avatar: The High Ground, an Avatar comic book series that’s a prequel to&nbsp;Avatar: The Way of Water.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>In the comics, it was revealed that his mother is Paz Socorro, a Scorpion pilot for the security operations team. In the comics, it said that she and Colonel Quaritch slept together, though were never in a relationship. Socorro died during the assault on the Tree of Souls, where the RDA fought against the Na’vi just so it could mine the unobtainium that could be found underneath the Hometree. Unfortunately, she died after she was hit by an arrow during the battle and was said to have a photo of Spider as a baby in her vehicle.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>While the assault on the Tree of Souls was an event that happened in the first Avatar movie, Socorro wasn’t a character in the movie. She was also introduced in the&nbsp;Avatar: The High Ground&nbsp;comic series, hence why her name wasn’t uttered in the film.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Fortunately for moviegoers, the film didn’t make a big deal about who Spider’s mother is. It focused more on his relationship with his father he returned to Pandora in his Avatar body. Additionally, the film gave a brief introduction to who Spider is and how he was left behind.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7Abr%2FPopueqqNiurDAx56pZqGeYq63rdOaqWasmJp6uK3YZqafZaeWwaa%2BjJqlnWWnlsBuv8eeZKKmXam1pnnFoqmsrF2btq25jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-did-lucas-glover-go-to-college-and-high-school.html><span>←</span><span>Where did Lucas Glover go to college and high school?</span></a>
