His breakout role came as an unstable recruit in the 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. A slew of movie roles followed, and in 2001, he was cast as Det. Robert Goren in the TV series, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, a role he would play for a decade.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Vincent Philip D'Onofrio was born on June 30, 1959, in Brooklyn, New York. The youngest of three children and only boy, D'Onofrio spent his early youth in New York until his mother, Phyllis, divorced his father, Gene, a theater production assistant and interior designer, and moved the family to Florida, where she started a new life with a new husband.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating high school, D'Onofrio drove across the country with his best friend and ended up living in Boulder, Colorado, working construction and laboring jobs to pay the rent. His time there included a brief stint at the University of Colorado.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career Beginnings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After exploring the community theater circuit in Boulder, D'Onofrio eventually allowed his interest in acting to bring him back to his native New York City. "I didn't know what I wanted to do," he once said. "But deep down, I knew it would be something artistic. In New York, I learned to respect the arts more. I started to go to [acting] classes, I studied, I took it seriously."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To make ends meet, the rugged, 6'3" actor worked as a bouncer in city clubs. "I saw a lot of things I would not necessarily talk about in an interview," he later recalled, with a laugh. "It was pretty crazy. There was a lot of violence. Some of it was really tough to be around."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his off-hours, D'Onofrio sought out stage roles. A series of off-Broadway parts followed. Then, in 1984, he made his Broadway debut in Open Admissions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His big break as a film actor came when he landed the memorable role of a mentally unstable recruit in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/stanley-kubrick data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stanley Kubrick" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s Full Metal Jacket (1987). It proved to be brutally demanding part, one that required D'Onofrio to gain 70 pounds and shave his head. "It changed my life," the actor later recalled. "Women didn't look at me; most of the time I was looking at their backs as they were running away. People used to say things to me twice, because they thought I was stupid."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still, the part led him to a slew of other film roles, including those in Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK (1991), The Player (1992), Ed Wood (1994), Men In Black (1997) and The Cell (2000).</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Law & Order'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1998, D'Onofrio was nominated for an Emmy for his guest role on the series Homicide: Life on the Street. Three years later, D'Onofrio was cast as NYPD Major Case Squad Detective Robert Goren in Dick Wolf’s TV series, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, a role that would make him a household name for a decade. In the series, D'Onofrio’s character is a quiet, intelligent detective who possesses a gift of intuition into human nature coupled with a keen ability to notice minute details of a crime. His partnership with the analytical Det. Alex Eames (played by Kathryn Erbe) made the series a lasting hit with viewers and fans of the franchise.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the years since leaving Law & Order, D'Onofrio has maintained a busy acting career. His film credits include Kill the Irishman (2011), Crackers (2011), American Falls (2012), Fire with Fire (2012) Chained (2012), and Jurassic World (2015) among others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015 D'Onofrio landed another memorable TV role when he was cast as the brooding and bald, Fisk, a.k.a., "the Kingpin" in the Netflix series Daredevil, the first in a series of shows that tells the story of the Marvel universe.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For several years, beginning in the 1990s, D'Onofrio was in a relationship with the actress, Greta Scacchi.
